149	Porchetta	Roasting skin-on pork belly that's been wrapped around a pork loin gives you the best of both worlds: crackling mahogany crust and juicy meat seasoned with fennel, chile, and orange. Start at least 24 hours ahead. First, ask your butcher for a skin-on pork belly that's just long and wide enough to wrap around a trimmed, center-cut pork loin.	Put belly skin side down; arrange loin in center. Roll belly around loin so the short ends of the belly meet. If any of the belly or loin overhangs, trim meat. Unroll; set loin aside.@newline@Toast fennel seeds and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Tip spices into a bowl; let cool. Finely grind spices in a spice mill and transfer to a small bowl, along with the sage, rosemary, and garlic; set fennel mixture aside.@newline@Assemble porchetta according to steps 1-5.@newline@Refrigerate roast, uncovered, for 1-2 days to allow skin to air-dry; pat occasionally with paper towels.@newline@Let porchetta sit at room temperature for 2 hours.

Reduce heat to 300F and continue roasting, rotating the pan and turning porchetta occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 145F, 1 1/2-2 hours more. If skin is not yet deep brown and crisp, increase heat to 500F and roast for 10 minutes more. Let rest for 30 minutes. Using a serrated knife, slice into 1/2" rounds.@newline@
150	Basic Cake Balls	Cake balls are bite-sized balls made of crumbled cake mixed with frosting and covered in candy coating. They are super-easy to make and form the basis of endless variations of decorated cake pops, cupcake pops, and cake bites.	Bake the cake as directed on the box, using a 9-by-13-inch cake pan. Let cool completely.@newline@Once the cake is cooled, get organized and set aside plenty of time (at least an hour) to crumble, roll, and dip 4 dozen cake balls.@newline@Crumble the cooled cake into a large mixing bowl. The texture of the cake causes it to crumble easily. Just cut a baked 9-by-13-inch cake into 4 equal sections. Remove a section from the pan, break it in half, and rub the two pieces together over a large bowl, making sure to crumble any large pieces that fall off. You can also use a fork to break any larger pieces of cake apart. Repeat with each section until the entire cake is crumbled into a fine texture. If you have large pieces mixed in, the cake balls may turn out lumpy and bumpy. You should not see any large pieces of cake.@newline@Add three-quarters of the container of frosting. (You will not need the remaining frosting.) Mix it into the crumbled cake, using the back of a large metal spoon, until thoroughly combined. If you use the entire container, the cake balls will be too moist.@newline@The mixture should be moist enough to roll into 1 1/2-inch balls and still hold a round shape. After rolling the cake balls by hand, place them on a wax paper-covered baking sheet.@newline@Cover with plastic wrap and chill for several hours in the refrigerator, or place in the freezer for about 15 minutes. You want the balls to be firm but not frozen.@newline@If you're making a project that calls for uncoated cake balls, stop here and proceed to decorate the cake balls, following the project instructions.@newline@Place the candy coating in a deep, microwave-safe plastic bowl. These bowls make it easier to cover the cake balls completely with candy coating while holding the bowl without burning your fingers. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)@newline@Melt the candy coating, following the instructions on the package. Microwave on medium power for 30 seconds at a time, stirring with a spoon in between. You can also use a double boiler. Either way, make sure you do not overheat the coating.@newline@Now you're ready to coat. Take a few cake balls at a time out of the refrigerator or freezer to work with. If they're in the freezer, transfer the rest of the balls to the refrigerator at this point, so they stay firm but do not freeze.@newline@Place one ball at a time into the bowl of candy coating. Spoon extra coating over any uncoated areas of the cake ball to make sure it is completely covered in candy coating. Then lift out the cake ball with your spoon. Avoid stirring it in the coating, because cake crumbs can fall off into the coating.@newline@Holding the spoon over the bowl, tap the handle of the spoon several times on the edge of the bowl until the excess coating falls off and back into the bowl. This technique also creates a smooth surface on the outside of the cake ball.@newline@Transfer the coated cake ball to another wax paper-covered baking sheet to dry. Let the coated cake ball slide right off the spoon. Some coating may pool around the base of the ball onto the wax paper. If so, simply take a toothpick and use it to draw a line around the base of the cake ball before the coating sets. Once the coating sets, you can break off any unwanted coating.@newline@Repeat with the remaining cake balls and let dry completely.@newline@If you have extra candy coating left over, pour it into a resealable plastic bag (and then snip off the corner) or into a squeeze bottle and drizzle it over the tops in a zigzag motion to decorate.@newline@You can make the cake balls ahead of time and store them in an airtight container on the counter or in the refrigerator for several days.@newline@

Pour pure through a sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, and discard seeds.@newline@Return juice to blender and blend together with ice, almonds, and garlic (in batches if necessary) until smooth. Add bread, vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste and blend, adding oil in a slow stream, until smooth.@newline@Top with diced watermelon.@newline@
152	Pineapple Upside-Down Gingerbread Cake	Jamie Davies and her late husband, Jack, were pioneers in the California wine industry. In 1965 they purchased and restored Schramsberg, a vineyard estate established in 1862, and they soon began producing the first American sparkling wine. When Davies thinks about comforting desserts, she remembers her childhood in Pasadena. "I was about eight when I started making upside-down cakes with my older sister, Dallas. Wed come home after school and mix up the recipe; I loved the sensual pleasure of making the batter. We'd put the cake in the oven, then go play croquet with our friends. Then wed all come in and eat it up. We thought we had died and gone to heaven."p@newline@pThe easy upside-downer here has wonderful spice flavors. Using canned pineapple chunks keeps the preparation simple.	For topping: Preheat oven to 350F. Melt 1/4 cup butter in 10-inch-diameter cast-iron skillet or other heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium heat. Add 2/3 cup brown sugar and stir until mixture begins to form thick mass, about 4 minutes. Continue cooking, without stirring, until butter mixture spreads and covers bottom of skillet and bubbles appear all over surface, about 6 minutes longer. Remove skillet from heat. Arrange pineapple chunks close together in concentric circles atop sugar mixture in skillet.@newline@

Divide onion wedges between prepared baking sheets. Brush onions on both sides with 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with 4 teaspoons thyme, salt, and pepper. Arrange onions cut side down and roast until golden brown on bottom, about 10 minutes. Turn onions over. Roast until golden brown and tender, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer to another large bowl.@newline@Divide green beans between same baking sheets. Drizzle beans with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup water, and 2 teaspoons thyme. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover tightly with foil and roast until almost crisp-tender, about 14 minutes. Uncover and continue to roast until water evaporates and beans are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl with onions. (Beets, onions, and green beans can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)@newline@Drizzle onions and green beans with balsamic vinegar; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with beets and serve warm or at room temperature.@newline@

The dinner is simple and delicious.p@newline@pA pizza stone is a worthwhile investment if you're partial to pizza with a crisp crust that doesnt droop. For this recipe we used a large pizza stone (about 14 inches across). But dont despair if you don't have one; we also achieved good results when we baked the pizza on a baking sheet.	At least 1 hour before baking pizza, set stone on lowest rack of oven (if you have a gas stove, stone can go directly on oven floor) and preheat oven to 500F.@newline@Coarsely grate mozzarella and cut tomatoes crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. On a floured surface with your hands pat out and stretch dough evenly into a 12-inch round, keeping hands flat. (Do not handle dough more than necessary. If dough is sticky, dust it lightly with flour.)@newline@Dust baker's peel with flour and carefully transfer inch round. Jerk peel once or twice and, if dough is sticking, lift dough and sprinkle flour underneath it, reshaping dough if necessary. Spread pesto over dough leaving a 1-inch border and sprinkle with cheese. Arrange tomato slices over cheese and season with salt and pepper.@newline@Line up far edge of peel with far edge of stone and tilt peel, jerking it gently to start pizza moving. Once edge of pizza touches stone, quickly pull back peel to completely transfer pizza to stone. Bake pizza until dough is crisp and brown, about 10 to 12 minutes, and transfer with peel to a cutting board.@newline@

197	Oyster Roast	Oyster-roast masters like Louis Osteen, who have been doing this for years, use huge pits or grills that are large enough to cook sausages, oysters, and clams all at the same time. We recommend using whatever type of oyster is locally available to you. Examine them carefullydiscard any that smell bad. If any are cracked or open, and don't close when tapped, discard those as well. When roasting oysters, it's important to keep them moist enough to create steam (hence the soaked burlap or water in the roasting pan). If roasted dry, they can explode.p@newline@pTo make this menu simpler, you could skip making the clams; there will still be plenty of food for everyone.	Charcoal grill method for sausages and oysters: Prepare grill for cooking with about 7 pounds of briquets. (Youll need about 15 pounds of briquets total.)@newline@Prick bratwursts and chorizo in several places with a fork, then grill, covered, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.@newline@Scatter about 12 additional briquets over glowing coals and replace rack.@newline@Fold burlap into a triple layer slightly smaller than grill surface and soak completely with water.

If roasted dry, they can explode.p@newline@pTo make this menu simpler, you could skip making the clams; there will still be plenty of food for everyone.

295	Papadzules	This is a classic Mayan dish from Yucatn made with the minimum of ingredients. Warmed corn tortillas are dipped into a pumpkin seed sauce from which the green oil has been extracted, and flavored with epazote. The tortillas are filled with chopped hard-cooked egg and topped with a tomato sauce. The final touch is given by little decorative pools of the green oil. Great care has to be taken to ensure that these ingredients are the freshest  slightly rancid or bitter pumpkin seeds can ruin it  and great care also should be taken in the preparation.	Have ready a warmed, not hot, serving dish or warmed individual dishes.@newline@Put the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.@newline@Spread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the volatile oil.@newline@Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds. If the seeds are ground too fine, then it will be more difficult to extract the oil.@newline@Have a small glass bowl ready for the oil.@newline@Put the ground seeds onto a plate that has a slight ridge around the rim. Measure out 1/4 cup (63ml) of the epazote broth and little by little sprinkle it  don't, for goodness' sake, pour the whole lot  over the seeds and work it with your hands, first having put the telephone on automatic answering. Gradually add the liquid until you have a crumbly but cohesive paste.@newline@Tilt the plate a little to one side and put a folded cloth underneath to hold it in that position. Start squeezing the paste and you will see that drops of oil will begin to extrude. Add a little more warm liquid if necessary  you probably won't need the whole amount  and keep squeezing until you have collected almost 4 tablespoons of dark green oil. (This is pure vitamin E, and great for the hands.) Crumble the paste into a blender jar, add the remaining strained epazote broth, if desired, and blend until smooth.@newline@Transfer the sauce to a skillet and warm through over the lowest possible heat, stirring almost constantly because the starch content of the seeds begins to swell and the particles tend to coagulate in the bottom of the pan.@newline@Dip one of the warm tortillas into the sauce: it should be lightly covered. If the sauce is too thick, dilute it with a little extra warm water. Work as quickly as you can, dipping each tortilla into the sauce, holding it with tongs but supporting it with a spatula so you don't get left with a bit of broken tortilla in your tongs. Sprinkle some of the chopped egg across one-third of the tortilla, roll it up, and place it on the warmed dish.@newline@When all the papadzules are assembled, pour the remaining sauce over them. (If the sauce has thickened and become grainy looking, put it back into the blender with a little extra warm water and blend until smooth.) Now pour on the tomato sauce and sprinkle the chopped egg whites and yolks. Decorate with the optional epazote. As a final touch, spoon in little pools of the oil. Serve immediately or the oil will sink back into the sauce and all that work will have been for naught! Of course, it is more colorful and attractive to serve the papadzules together on one serving dish.@newline@

328	Cheese Fondue	If you wanted to entertain in the '60s, a fondue pot was de rigueur, presenting a casual alternative to the formal dinners of earlier eras. Some of us still have the dregs of that original bottle of kirsch in the back of the liquor cabinet. This is fortunate because, with the current and unprecedented cheese renaissance in this country, it's time to unearth that old fondue pot and light up the Sterno.	Rub inside of a 4-quart heavy pot with cut sides of garlic, then discard garlic. Add wine to pot and bring just to a simmer over moderate heat.@newline@Stir together cornstarch and kirsch in a cup.@newline@Gradually add cheese to pot and cook, stirring constantly in a zigzag pattern (not a circular motion) to prevent cheese from balling up, until cheese is just melted and creamy (do not let boil).

331	Papadzules	This is a classic Mayan dish from Yucatn made with the minimum of ingredients. Warmed corn tortillas are dipped into a pumpkin seed sauce from which the green oil has been extracted, and flavored with epazote. The tortillas are filled with chopped hard-cooked egg and topped with a tomato sauce. The final touch is given by little decorative pools of the green oil. Great care has to be taken to ensure that these ingredients are the freshest  slightly rancid or bitter pumpkin seeds can ruin it  and great care also should be taken in the preparation.	Have ready a warmed, not hot, serving dish or warmed individual dishes.@newline@Put the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.@newline@Spread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the volatile oil.@newline@Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds. If the seeds are ground too fine, then it will be more difficult to extract the oil.@newline@Have a small glass bowl ready for the oil.@newline@Put the ground seeds onto a plate that has a slight ridge around the rim. Measure out 1/4 cup (63ml) of the epazote broth and little by little sprinkle it  don't, for goodness' sake, pour the whole lot  over the seeds and work it with your hands, first having put the telephone on automatic answering. Gradually add the liquid until you have a crumbly but cohesive paste.@newline@Tilt the plate a little to one side and put a folded cloth underneath to hold it in that position. Start squeezing the paste and you will see that drops of oil will begin to extrude. Add a little more warm liquid if necessary  you probably won't need the whole amount  and keep squeezing until you have collected almost 4 tablespoons of dark green oil. (This is pure vitamin E, and great for the hands.) Crumble the paste into a blender jar, add the remaining strained epazote broth, if desired, and blend until smooth.@newline@Transfer the sauce to a skillet and warm through over the lowest possible heat, stirring almost constantly because the starch content of the seeds begins to swell and the particles tend to coagulate in the bottom of the pan.@newline@Dip one of the warm tortillas into the sauce: it should be lightly covered. If the sauce is too thick, dilute it with a little extra warm water. Work as quickly as you can, dipping each tortilla into the sauce, holding it with tongs but supporting it with a spatula so you don't get left with a bit of broken tortilla in your tongs. Sprinkle some of the chopped egg across one-third of the tortilla, roll it up, and place it on the warmed dish.@newline@When all the papadzules are assembled, pour the remaining sauce over them. (If the sauce has thickened and become grainy looking, put it back into the blender with a little extra warm water and blend until smooth.) Now pour on the tomato sauce and sprinkle the chopped egg whites and yolks. Decorate with the optional epazote. As a final touch, spoon in little pools of the oil. Serve immediately or the oil will sink back into the sauce and all that work will have been for naught! Of course, it is more colorful and attractive to serve the papadzules together on one serving dish.@newline@
332	Farfalle with Peas and Pancetta		Shell fresh peas if using. Diagonally cut sugar snaps and/or snow peas into thirds. Finely chop pancetta and shallots separately.@newline@Fill a 6-quart pasta pot three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for peas and pasta.

Heat mixture over low heat, gently tossing (and adding more pasta water as needed if mixture becomes dry), until just heated through.@newline@
333	Curried Chicken Legs with Okra and Potatoes	For those who've found the consistency of okra unappealing, there are secrets to keeping it crisp and toothsome: Don't cut into the pod when trimming the stems and don't overcook it.	Cut chicken legs into drumsticks and thighs and discard skin and any fat from chicken. (To remove skin from drumsticks, hold drumstick at large end, grip skin with a paper towel, and pull skin over small end.) Pat chicken dry.

Spoon 1/2 cup chocolate mousse into bottom of prepared pie crust; spread evenly over bottom of crust. Sprinkle 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons crushed chocolate wafers over mousse. Top with remaining mousse, mounding in the center to create a dome. (The point is to add height, not to spread out evenly to edges.) Chill pie.@newline@Beat remaining 2 cups cream, crme frache, and salt until medium-stiff peaks form (when the beaters are lifted from the cream, the peaks will hold their shape but the tips will fall over). Top chocolate mousse with whipped-cream mixture, following the same rounded dome shape. Chill pie for at least 4 hours or, covered, for up to 3 days. (It will slice best if chilled overnight, allowing mousse to set properly.)@newline@Garnish pie with 2 tablespoons chocolate wafers and chocolate shavings. Slice pie using a clean, dry knife; wipe between slices to ensure clean, elegant pieces.@newline@
408	Corn Pudding with Mushrooms and Ham	Because overcooking can cause this comforting pudding to separate, take it out of the oven when it's still slightly wiggly in the center. Then give it a quick flash under the broiler to brown it.	Arrange a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350F. Generously butter an 8x8x2" glass baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons cheese.@newline@Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.

409	Ember-Roasted Corn on the Cob	Andrea Reusing, chef at Lantern in Chapel Hill, NC, cooks whole ears of corn in the dying embers of a charcoal fire after the burgers or pork chops have finished cooking. "I love the efficiency of it," she says. The waning heat produces some sweeter bites and others that are more charred. Keep the husks on to protect the corn, and soak the ears before they hit the embers so the kernels don't dry out.	Gently pull husks away from corn (do not detach from cob); remove silk. Pull husks up over corn to cover kernels. Secure husks tightly with string or a strip of foil. Soak in a large pot of room-temperature water for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.@newline@Meanwhile, remove grill grate and build a hot fire in a charcoal grill, allowing fire to burn down until coals are completely covered with ash (or use the ash-covered coals remaining after grilling a main course).@newline@Push coals to one side of grill. Arrange 3 ears of corn in a single layer on cleared side of grill; cover corn with coals. Repeat on the other side with remaining coals and corn, spreading coals evenly over corn. Roast corn until most of the kernels are deep golden brown, about 10 minutes (some kernels will be flecked with dark brown spots). Remove husks; use a pastry brush to flick off any ashes. Serve with butter and salt.@newline@

413	Cherry-Bourbon Pie	This crumble-topped pie stars the flavors of an Old Fashioned cocktail. Our secret weapon: jarred sour cherries (just think of all those cherries you won't have to pit!). We like Trader Joe's Dark Morello Cherries, but other brands work well, too.	For crumble: Whisk all ingredients except butter in a medium bowl until no lumps of sugar remain. Rub butter into oat mixture with your fingertips until it's completely incorporated. If butter begins to soften while mixing, chill mixture to firm it up, about 15 minutes (cold butter ensures a flaky, tender crumble). Cover and chill crumble up to 5 days ahead.@newline@
