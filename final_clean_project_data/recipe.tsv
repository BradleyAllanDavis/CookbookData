149	Porchetta	Roasting skin-on pork belly that's been wrapped around a pork loin gives you the best of both worlds: crackling mahogany crust and juicy meat seasoned with fennel, chile, and orange. Start at least 24 hours ahead. First, ask your butcher for a skin-on pork belly that's just long and wide enough to wrap around a trimmed, center-cut pork loin.	Put belly skin side down; arrange loin in center. Roll belly around loin so the short ends of the belly meet. If any of the belly or loin overhangs, trim meat. Unroll; set loin aside.@newline@Toast fennel seeds and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Tip spices into a bowl; let cool. Finely grind spices in a spice mill and transfer to a small bowl, along with the sage, rosemary, and garlic; set fennel mixture aside.@newline@Assemble porchetta according to steps 1-5.@newline@Refrigerate roast, uncovered, for 1-2 days to allow skin to air-dry; pat occasionally with paper towels.@newline@Let porchetta sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 500F. Season porchetta with salt. Roast on rack in baking sheet, turning once, for 40 minutes. Reduce heat to 300F and continue roasting, rotating the pan and turning porchetta occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 145F, 1 1/2-2 hours more. If skin is not yet deep brown and crisp, increase heat to 500F and roast for 10 minutes more. Let rest for 30 minutes. Using a serrated knife, slice into 1/2" rounds.	1
150	Basic Cake Balls	Cake balls are bite-sized balls made of crumbled cake mixed with frosting and covered in candy coating. They are super-easy to make and form the basis of endless variations of decorated cake pops, cupcake pops, and cake bites.	Bake the cake as directed on the box, using a 9-by-13-inch cake pan. Let cool completely.@newline@Once the cake is cooled, get organized and set aside plenty of time (at least an hour) to crumble, roll, and dip 4 dozen cake balls.@newline@Crumble the cooled cake into a large mixing bowl. The texture of the cake causes it to crumble easily. Just cut a baked 9-by-13-inch cake into 4 equal sections. Remove a section from the pan, break it in half, and rub the two pieces together over a large bowl, making sure to crumble any large pieces that fall off. You can also use a fork to break any larger pieces of cake apart. Repeat with each section until the entire cake is crumbled into a fine texture. If you have large pieces mixed in, the cake balls may turn out lumpy and bumpy. You should not see any large pieces of cake.@newline@Add three-quarters of the container of frosting. (You will not need the remaining frosting.) Mix it into the crumbled cake, using the back of a large metal spoon, until thoroughly combined. If you use the entire container, the cake balls will be too moist.@newline@The mixture should be moist enough to roll into 1 1/2-inch balls and still hold a round shape. After rolling the cake balls by hand, place them on a wax paper-covered baking sheet.@newline@Cover with plastic wrap and chill for several hours in the refrigerator, or place in the freezer for about 15 minutes. You want the balls to be firm but not frozen.@newline@If you're making a project that calls for uncoated cake balls, stop here and proceed to decorate the cake balls, following the project instructions.@newline@Place the candy coating in a deep, microwave-safe plastic bowl. These bowls make it easier to cover the cake balls completely with candy coating while holding the bowl without burning your fingers. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)@newline@Melt the candy coating, following the instructions on the package. Microwave on medium power for 30 seconds at a time, stirring with a spoon in between. You can also use a double boiler. Either way, make sure you do not overheat the coating.@newline@Now you're ready to coat. Take a few cake balls at a time out of the refrigerator or freezer to work with. If they're in the freezer, transfer the rest of the balls to the refrigerator at this point, so they stay firm but do not freeze.@newline@Place one ball at a time into the bowl of candy coating. Spoon extra coating over any uncoated areas of the cake ball to make sure it is completely covered in candy coating. Then lift out the cake ball with your spoon. Avoid stirring it in the coating, because cake crumbs can fall off into the coating.@newline@Holding the spoon over the bowl, tap the handle of the spoon several times on the edge of the bowl until the excess coating falls off and back into the bowl. This technique also creates a smooth surface on the outside of the cake ball.@newline@Transfer the coated cake ball to another wax paper-covered baking sheet to dry. Let the coated cake ball slide right off the spoon. Some coating may pool around the base of the ball onto the wax paper. If so, simply take a toothpick and use it to draw a line around the base of the cake ball before the coating sets. Once the coating sets, you can break off any unwanted coating.@newline@Repeat with the remaining cake balls and let dry completely.@newline@If you have extra candy coating left over, pour it into a resealable plastic bag (and then snip off the corner) or into a squeeze bottle and drizzle it over the tops in a zigzag motion to decorate.@newline@You can make the cake balls ahead of time and store them in an airtight container on the counter or in the refrigerator for several days.	2
151	Plum-Glazed Stuffed Shiitake Mushrooms	Here is an Asian twist on stuffed mushrooms. Chinese plum sauce and sesame oil make the satisfying, intensely flavored glaze.

Stir plum sauce in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Whisk in oil. Brush mushrooms with all of plum sauce mixture. (Can be made 1 day ahead.

Marinate at room temperature 1 hour or chill up to 8 hours, turning chicken occasionally.@newline@Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, 1/4 cup dill, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon peel in small bowl; whisk to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to use.@newline@Steam potatoes until just tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper.@newline@Combine zucchini slices and 2 tablespoons olive oil in medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt; toss to coat. Heat grill pan or large ridged cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 4 minutes. Working in batches, grill zucchini slices until just crisp-tender, about 1 minute per side; transfer to plate. Grill chicken until brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to work surface; cool 15 minutes. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes; add to potatoes in bowl. Mix in celery, olives, and dressing; season with salt and pepper.@newline@Overlap zucchini slices around edge of platter. Mound chicken salad in center.	1
153	Arugula and Green Bean Salad with Walnut Oil Dressing	The walnut oil adds a distinctive flavor here. You can substitute olive oil and just sprinkle toasted walnuts over each serving.

If any are cracked or open, and don't close when tapped, discard those as well. When roasting oysters, it's important to keep them moist enough to create steam (hence the soaked burlap or water in the roasting pan). If roasted dry, they can explode.p	Charcoal grill method for sausages and oysters: Prepare grill for cooking with about 7 pounds of briquets.

223	Papadzules	This is a classic Mayan dish from Yucatn made with the minimum of ingredients. Warmed corn tortillas are dipped into a pumpkin seed sauce from which the green oil has been extracted, and flavored with epazote. The tortillas are filled with chopped hard-cooked egg and topped with a tomato sauce. The final touch is given by little decorative pools of the green oil. Great care has to be taken to ensure that these ingredients are the freshest  slightly rancid or bitter pumpkin seeds can ruin it  and great care also should be taken in the preparation.	Have ready a warmed, not hot, serving dish or warmed individual dishes.@newline@Put the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.@newline@Spread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the volatile oil.@newline@Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds. If the seeds are ground too fine, then it will be more difficult to extract the oil.@newline@Have a small glass bowl ready for the oil.@newline@Put the ground seeds onto a plate that has a slight ridge around the rim. Measure out 1/4 cup (63ml) of the epazote broth and little by little sprinkle it  don't, for goodness' sake, pour the whole lot  over the seeds and work it with your hands, first having put the telephone on automatic answering. Gradually add the liquid until you have a crumbly but cohesive paste.@newline@Tilt the plate a little to one side and put a folded cloth underneath to hold it in that position. Start squeezing the paste and you will see that drops of oil will begin to extrude. Add a little more warm liquid if necessary  you probably won't need the whole amount  and keep squeezing until you have collected almost 4 tablespoons of dark green oil. (This is pure vitamin E, and great for the hands.) Crumble the paste into a blender jar, add the remaining strained epazote broth, if desired, and blend until smooth.@newline@Transfer the sauce to a skillet and warm through over the lowest possible heat, stirring almost constantly because the starch content of the seeds begins to swell and the particles tend to coagulate in the bottom of the pan.@newline@Dip one of the warm tortillas into the sauce: it should be lightly covered. If the sauce is too thick, dilute it with a little extra warm water. Work as quickly as you can, dipping each tortilla into the sauce, holding it with tongs but supporting it with a spatula so you don't get left with a bit of broken tortilla in your tongs. Sprinkle some of the chopped egg across one-third of the tortilla, roll it up, and place it on the warmed dish.@newline@When all the papadzules are assembled, pour the remaining sauce over them. (If the sauce has thickened and become grainy looking, put it back into the blender with a little extra warm water and blend until smooth.) Now pour on the tomato sauce and sprinkle the chopped egg whites and yolks. Decorate with the optional epazote. As a final touch, spoon in little pools of the oil. Serve immediately or the oil will sink back into the sauce and all that work will have been for naught! Of course, it is more colorful and attractive to serve the papadzules together on one serving dish.	9

273	Grilled Steak Salad with Tomato Vinaigrette	A great summer salad requires three things: fresh greens, a tart, seasonal dressing (made here with grated tomato), and a light hand to toss the ingredients together so the lettuces stay perky.	Season steak with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper; set aside. Grate cut sides of tomato on coarse holes of a box grater into a medium bowl down to the skin; discard skin. Add shallot and vinegar; whisk in 1/4 cup oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.

276	The BA Burger Deluxe	Five ingredients and five steps will get you to burger heaven.	Divide meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Place 1 portion on a work surface. Cup your hands around the meat and begin to gently shape it into a rounded mound. (Use light pressure as you shape so you don't pack the meat too tightly.) Lightly press down on the top of the meat with your palm to gently flatten it. Continue rotating and cupping the meat, patting the top of it occasionally, until you've formed a 4"-diameter, 3/4"-thick patty. Using your thumb, make a small indentation in the center to help keep the burger flat as it cooks. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining portions.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Season one side of patties with salt and pepper; place on grill, seasoned side down. Grill until lightly charred on bottom, about 4 minutes. Season other side, turn, and top with cheese. Grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes longer for medium. Transfer burgers to buns and let stand for 3 minutes before serving.	3
277	Cold-Brew Iced Coffee Concentrate	For a clear liquid, use coarsely ground coffee. (Finely ground beans make for a cloudier drink.)	Place ground coffee in a large container. Gradually add 7 cups cold water. Stir gently to be sure all grounds are moistened. Cover with a layer of cheesecloth. Let stand at room temperature for 15 hours.@newline@Remove cheesecloth and use it to line a fine-mesh sieve set over a large pitcher. Pour coffee through sieve into pitcher (do not stir); rinse jar and set aside. Discard cheesecloth with solids.@newline@Line same sieve with a large coffee filter and set over reserved jar. Strain coffee through sieve into jar. (It may take up to 45 minutes for all of the coffee to drip through; do not stir or coffee may become cloudy.) Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Coffee concentrate can be made 2 weeks ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Fill a glass with ice. Dilute 1 part coffee concentrate with 1 part milk, if desired, or water.	5
278	Oatmeal Cookie	Another dessert cocktail made with oatmeal stout, the Oatmeal Cookie gets a spicy edge from Goldschlger, a Swiss cinnamon schnapps that has thin flakes of gold leaf floating in it.	1. Fill a cocktail shaker halfway full with ice cubes. Add the molasses, port, and Goldschlger. Shake until cold.@newline@2. Strain into four old-fashioned glasses. Top with the oatmeal stout, and serve.	5
279	Maru	Maru is the name of the adorable Japanese cat whose love of jumping into and out of boxes has inspired us to waste many happy hours drinking beer in front of our computer when we should have been working instead. This cocktail has the popular Japanese lager Sapporo as its base, a crisp and well-carbonated brew that is typically paired with sushi. Here, the slight bitterness of the beer is tempered by tart berries and mandarin oranges.	1. Muddle the blackberries in the bottom of a cocktail shaker. Fill the shaker halfway full with ice cubes, add the mandarin orange juice, Chambord, and St-Germain, and shake vigorously.@newline@2. Strain into four goblets or wine glasses, top with the Sapporo, and serve.	3
280	Bloodied Belgian	Here's a take on the classic Blood and Sand cocktail, using Flemish-style sour ale or pkriekp (which means "cherry") lambic instead of cherry liqueur. Lambic is a distinctively Belgian style of beer, made with wild yeast as opposed to the carefully controlled fermentation of conventional ales. It is often flavored with fruit, such as cherries or raspberries. Thanks to Eben Freeman, who serves a version of this drink at Ai Fiori in New York City.	1. Fill a cocktail shaker halfway full with ice cubes. Add the Scotch, vermouth, and blood orange juice and shake until blended.@newline@2. Strain into a cocktail glass. Top with the ale, drop in the cherries for garnish, and serve.	11
281	Grilled Kale Salad with Ricotta and Plums	Quickly grilling kale makes it crispy. Pairing it with fresh plums and ricotta transforms it into our new favorite salad.	Whisk 3 tablespoons oil, vinegar, thyme, and honey in a medium bowl. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Add plums and toss to coat; transfer plums to a plate.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush kale leaves with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt. Grill kale, turning once, until crispy and charred at edges, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a work surface; let stand until cool enough to handle. Remove large center stems with a knife and discard (just trim the tough ends from smaller, more tender kale stems).@newline@Divide ricotta among plates; season with salt and pepper. Stir vinaigrette again. Tear larger kale leaves into pieces (leave smaller leaves whole). Place leaves in a large bowl and toss with some of the vinaigrette. Divide leaves among plates. Top with plums and drizzle some vinaigrette over.	10
282	Clinched Double-Wide Loin Lamb Chops	When Pete and I tried this in London, we were amazed. It's probably what made us decide to do a whole chapter in clinching. Lamb that doesn't flare up, leaving a slick black residue, is the Holy Grail of every lamb griller. You can cook these chops quickly, with no flame, to produce a beautiful crust and, on the inside, p pointp (perfect) lamb.p@newline@pFor the most part I avoid clinching with bone-in pieces, but here the bone doesn't affect the cooking at allit's essentially just a way of holding the two loin sections together, which makes for a different presentation from a typical lamb chop. You'll need to get these chops from a specialty butcher.p	Allow the lamb to come to room temperature, approximately 1 hour if straight from the refrigerator.@newline@Prepare a "mature level" coal bed, with a clean thin grate or rack set over it if you like; the fire should be very hot.@newline@Season the lamb chops on both sides with the seasoning blend, then lightly moisten your hands with water and work the seasonings into the meat. Allow to stand for 5 minutes to develop a "meat paste."*@newline@Fan or blow-dry excess ash from the coal fire.@newline@Using an herb brush, brush the chops lightly all over with the butter baste. Put the lamb chops on the grill grate or directly on the coals and cook, without moving them, for 3 minutes. Turn, baste lightly, and cook for 3 minutes, then repeat, basting each time the chops are flipped.@newline@Put the foil-wrapped brick on the grill grate or on the coals to be used as a steady point for the chops, lean the chops up against it, fat side down, and cook for 1 minute, or until the internal temperature registers 120F on an instant-read thermometer.@newline@Meanwhile, pour the dressing board onto a cutting board (or mix it directly on the board). Finely chop the tip of the herb brush and mix the herbs into the dressing.@newline@Transfer the lamb chops to the cutting board and turn in the dressing to coat, then transfer to plates and serve.	5
283	White Bean Salad	Creamy white beans, fresh basil, and crunchy young vegetables are combined in a light but substantial salad that takes advantage of the first fruits of the spring garden. Use a mild honey, like clover or wildflower. Chef Sam	1. If you're using dried beans, first rinse them, picking out any stones, and place in a bowl. Cover with cold water and soak for 8 hours, or overnight, then drain the beans and place in a pot. Add the garlic and bay leaf and enough water to cover the beans by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour.@newline@2. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, honey, and shallot. Whisk to combine.@newline@3. When the beans are done, drain them well and place in a medium bowl.

If using canned beans, rinse and drain them, then toss with the vinaigrette.@newline@4. In a small pot of boiling water, cook the snow peas or sugar snap peas for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, place them in a bowl of ice water. Drain, pat dry, and slice thin.@newline@5. In a large salad bowl, place the cooled beans, snow peas, chives, radishes, and basil. Pour the remaining dressing over and toss lightly. Serve immediately.	11
284	Mesclun Salad with Veggies, Goat Cheese, and Crispy Garlic	Fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff shared this recipe for one of her favorite saladsit's an updated take on a salad her Mom made when she was growing up in San Diego. We've included quantities for all the ingredients, but Minkoff encourages you to make this dish your own and to taste as you go.p	In a small saut pan over moderate heat, melt the butter until it begins to bubble slightly. Add the garlic and saut, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 2 minutes. Pour the garlic and butter into a small bowl and let cool.

285	Arya's Snitched Tarts	She filched one anyway, and ate it on her way out. It was stuffed with chopped nuts and fruit and cheese, the crust flaky and still warm from the oven. Eating Ser Amory's tart made Arya feel daring.p Barefoot surefoot lightfoot_, she sang under her breath. I am the ghost in Harrenhal._ pA Clash of Kingsp@newline@pMedieval Arya Tartp@newline@These tarts take a while to make, but they are worth every minute. The pastries look like one could easily overindulge, but each small shortbread cookie is a commitment. The fruit syrup is heavy and chewy; our British readers may recognize this dessert as the medieval ancestor of the Jammie Dodger.p	Bring the wine and honey to a boil, then reduce the heat and skim off the foam until the liquid is clear. Add the vinegar, poudre forte, and fruits; return the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Keep an eye on the fruit as you proceeddo not overreduce it! The syrup should lightly coat the back of a spoon and reduce by about a third to a half.@newline@Roll the sweet dough to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured board, then use a circular cutter or drinking glass to cut out circles about 2 inches in diameter.@newline@Pour a shallow layer of oil into a skillet or pan and place it over medium-high heat until hot. Working a few at a time, gently slip dough circles into the oil and fry until they are lightly browned and very crisp. Transfer the fried circles to paper towels to drain. Arrange the cakes on a serving platter, then spoon on just enough of the fruit mixture to cover each disk. Sprinkle with candied nuts. The yellowish cakes and the red topping make an interesting contrast in colors, and the wine will soften the cakes.	12
286	Edible Stones	NoDescription	The garlic confit Pour the oil into a small, deep saucepan and place on the cooker (stove) top or over very low and steady heat, making sure it does not reach a very high temperature. Heating the oil can also be done over the edge of the cooker top so that it is done as gently as possible. When the oil is warm, place the separated, unpeeled garlic cloves in the oil and poach them gently for approximately 2 hours. They should be tender, easy to peel and thoroughly impregnated with oil. When ready, drain the oil, peel the garlic cloves, crush them, then pass them through a chinois and set aside.	8

The honeyfingers fry to a crispy crunch on the outside while remaining a bit chewy on the inside. The pieces are easy to cut into shapes, and could probably even be rolled into logs. The flavor is really all about the honey, but the pepper and cinnamon on top, as well as the pine nuts, add a slight complexity.p	In a medium saucepan, whisk the 2/3 cup flour a little at a time into the cold milk so that there are no lumps. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the sherry, and cook on medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until a thick porridge forms. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir briskly to cool the mixture.@newline@When the porridge is lukewarm, add the egg and stir briskly until it is blended. Stir in the pine nuts and a dash of cinnamon and pepper.

294	Dubonnet Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the red option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. Dubonnet takes center stage in Frizell's Sangria but is a supporting player in many classic cocktail recipes, including the gin-based Dubonnet cocktail (also known as the Zaza). It's an aperitif wine that Frizell says is similar to vermouth and has been popular in French cafs since the 19th century.	In a large bowl, combine the orange wedges, lemon quarters, Cognac, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Using a muddler or a wooden spoon, press down on the fruit mixture until the juice is released and the sugar is dissolved. Add the Dubonnet and stir to combine. Strain the mixture into a large pitcher and discard the fruit. Add the orange half wheels, lemon slices, and bitters, if using. Stir gently to combine then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. When ready to serve, add the sparkling water, then carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Taste and add additional sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary.	1
295	Cucumber-Vermouth Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the blue option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. The drink gets its oceanlike hue from just 1 ounce of blue curaao, but if color isn't important to you, feel free to use regular (clear) curaao instead. Frizell warns against using cheap vermouth: "An excellent dry vermouth, like Dolin, is necessary for this recipe." The drizzle of Maraschino liqueur, Frizell explains, "adds a nutty, bittersweet note."	In a large pitcher, combine the lemon slices, cucumber slices, and vermouth. Stir gently then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. When ready to serve, add the curaao, simple syrup, lemon juice, gin, sparkling water, and Maraschino liqueur, if using. Carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Garnish glasses with mint, plus additional lemon and cucumber slices.	4
296	Pineapple Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the white option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. For this Caribbean-inspired pitcher drink, Frizell recommends using good white rum or, even better, a mix of white rum and aged rum. "A funky aged Jamaican rum, like Smith & Cross, will add a profound depth of flavor to the mix," he notes. For the wine, Frizell says to use a young unoaked white, such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a dry Riesling.	In a large pitcher, combine 2 cups pineapple, white wine, simple syrup, and rum. Stir gently then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, add the coconut water, lime juice, lime slices, and sparkling water. Add the Maraschino liqueur, if using, then carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Garnish glasses with the remaining pineapple, if desired, or add the fruit to the pitcher.	7

300	Shiny Happy Poppers	Nothing puts a smile on people's faces faster while at the same time setting their tongues ablaze, like these grilled jalapeo poppers. Sans cheese, and debuting with a snazzy new look, these Shiny Happy Poppers are every bit a modern twist on what still remains a classic firebrand when it comes to pregame appetizers. However, a word to the wise: Having an ice-cold beer nearby is highly recommended, should this blaze get out of control.	Heat the grill to medium-high.@newline@Stem the jalapeos and cut one lengthwise slit in each pepper. Pull out the seeds and inner ribs with your fingers (wear rubber gloves if your skin is sensitive to handling hot peppers).@newline@In a medium-size bowl, combine the rice, black beans, mustard, garlic powder, and thyme.

In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks just to break them up, then whisk in the malted milk powder. Set aside.@newline@2. In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, stir together the cream, milk, sugar, and salt and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture approaches a bare simmer, reduce the heat to medium.@newline@3. Carefully scoop out about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another 1/2 cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.@newline@4. Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula, 1 to 2 minutes longer.@newline@5. Strain the base through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container. Set the container into an ice-water bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the base for at least 2 hours or overnight.	10
302	String Bean & Arugula Salad	In this unusual pairing, the string beans and baby arugula work wonders for each other. Wilting the arugula with the hot, garlicky grilled beans is a nice trick for bringing the two together. While you can use regular arugula if you must, baby arugula is far milder in flavor, so try to find it if you can.	Heat the grill to medium-high.@newline@In a large bowl, toss the string beans with the olive oil and garlic. Let the beans rest for 10 minutes or so, then place the beans on a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Fold the foil over the beans and fold down the ends of the foil twice. Place the foil packet on the grill, seam side up, and grill for 25 to 30 minutes. Let the beans cool for a few minutes, then combine them in a roomy bowl with the arugula, lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing until the arugula is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.	7
303	Vanilla Extract	NoDescription	1. Fill a mason jar or bottle with vodka. After you use the seeds of a vanilla bean in a recipe, rinse off the vanilla bean and put it in the vodka. You'll need at least 3 vanilla beans in there for at least 3 weeks to get a good extract going, but it's fine to use more beans, too. Your extract is ready when it is a lovely brown color and it smells like vanilla.@newline@2. Either pour the extract it into a new bottle and start over or keep topping off the working bottle with vodka and keep shoving more vanilla beans into the bottle. As long as you don't let it get too empty, you can keep using the extract indefinitely even as you continue to top it off.	10
304	Smoked Scotch Eggs	Sausage-wrapped "Scotch" eggs are a tasty and interesting dish when breaded and fried in the traditional manner, but cooking them on the smoker makes a very special treat. The homemade sausage gets a nice crust on the outside and, if you get it cooked just right, the egg yolk will have a little bit of ooze on the inside. Just make sure to seal the sausage all the way around the egg before smoking. I like to serve these as an appetizer, but they are also fine as a nice smoked addition to a lunch salad.	Put the eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Let rest for 15 minutes to warm them up before cooking. (This will help keep them from cracking.) Over high heat, bring the eggs to a boil, rolling them around in the pot frequently. When the water begins to boil, start timing and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to roll the eggs around in the pan. (This will keep the yolks in the center.) Remove the eggs from the boiling water quickly and submerge them in ice water to stop the cooking. When the eggs are cool, peel them and refrigerate.@newline@Put the pork in a medium bowl and add the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne. Mix well and then divide the sausage into six equal portions. On waxed paper, flatten out one of the portions to a 4-inch circle. Top with an egg and wrap the sausage all around the egg, stretching as needed and sealing it completely. Do this with all the eggs and then season them liberally with the rub. Put the eggs on a pan lined with wax paper and refrigerate for 1 hour.@newline@Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor.@newline@Place the eggs on a grill topper or directly on the cooking grate and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden brown and firm to the touch.@newline@Transfer the eggs to a plate and let cool. Cut them in halves or quarters and serve with barbecue sauce for dipping.	5
305	Bacon-Wrapped Pig Wings	Who says pigs can't fly? Take a few boneless pork chops, add some bacon and a little creativity, and Pig Wings are on the menu! The bacon adds great flavor and keeps the loin meat from getting dry. These look delicious and are a little unusual, so they make a fabulous smoked appetizer with barbecue sauce for dipping. The kids will love them.	Cut each pork chop into three strips. To wrap the "wings," start by overlapping the bacon on one end of a pork strip, then wrapping it up and around in a candy-cane fashion. Secure the bacon at the top with a toothpick. If you need to use a toothpick at both ends, go ahead. Season the bacon-wrapped wings liberally with the rub.@newline@Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor. Place the wings directly on the cooking grid and cook for 90 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked. You may want to finish these on a hot grill or under the broiler to crisp the bacon. Serve hot with barbecue sauce for dipping.	6
306	Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce	Mushrooms and beef have long been an inspired combination, and here they're joined in a particularly sophisticated way. Dried porcini mushrooms grind to a powder in no time in a blender and add a subtle woodsiness to the beef, while the truffle butter enriches the sauce with its heady aroma. Black-truffle butter is the best deal going. It gives you tremendous flavor at an affordable price, a fraction of the cost of a fresh black truffle.	Make a deep cut into the top side of tenderloin, about 4 inches from tail end, to facilitate folding the tail end under the roast to give the meat a more uniform thickness. Tie roast at 1-inch intervals with kitchen string.@newline@Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Pat tenderloin dry and sprinkle all over with 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper, rubbing into meat.@newline@Set roasting pan over 2 burners, then add 3 tablespoons oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Brown tenderloin on all sides, about 10 minutes.@newline@Sprinkle porcini powder evenly on top of tenderloin and roast in oven until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of thickest part of meat registers 120F, 30 to 40 minutes.@newline@Toward end of roasting tenderloin, stir together truffle butter and flour. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, and saut mushrooms with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper until liquid released by the mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are tender and golden, 10 to 12 minutes.@newline@Add 2 cups stock to skillet and simmer, stirring up brown bits, 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat.@newline@Transfer tenderloin to a cutting board and let stand 15 minutes (internal temperature will rise to about 130F for medium-rare).@newline@Set roasting pan over 2 burners and add remaining 1 cup stock. Bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits, then pour stock into mushroom mixture in skillet.@newline@Bring mushroom mixture to a boil and whisk in truffle butter mixture, bit by bit. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in scallion greens and salt and pepper to taste.@newline@Cut tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick slices, discarding string, and serve with sauce.	3
307	Chocolate-Dipped Spritz Washboards with Pistachios	Although the origins of spritz cookies are fuzzysome say they come from Scandinavia, while others cite GermanyI'm inclined to believe it's the latter, because pspritzenp means to squirt in German, which is how these cookies are formed: The dough is squirted from a cookie press. You can make any shape you want, but we love these old-fashioned washboard strips. If the idea of yet another piece of kitchen equipment deters you, rest assured these cookies are so delicious, you'll be baking them more than once a year. A cookie press is not expensive and with all the different shapes you can make from the dough, it will more than pay for itself in fun and entertainment over the years for the child in all of us.	Make Cookies: Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, with the following exceptions:@newline@Eliminate the egg.@newline@Substitute 1 cup confectioners' sugar for the granulated sugar and substitute 3/4 teaspoon almond extract for the 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.@newline@Pack the cylinder of the press with some of the dough. Proceed according to the cookie press instructions. Pipe the dough in 3-inch-long strips onto a large ungreased baking sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart. Use a paring knife to cut the dough free from the cookie press.@newline@Freeze or chill the cookies on the baking sheet until firm.@newline@Bake until edges are pale golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on sheets 2 minutes, then transfer cookies with a metal spatula to racks to cool.@newline@Continue to pipe, chill, and bake more spritz washboards in batches with remaining dough (pipe and chill on second sheet while first sheet is baking; cool baking sheets between batches and use fresh parchment paper).	3
308	French Onion Bites	Think of these as the best part of French onion soup minus the broth. Better yet, they're in a form that's much easier to eat than the soggy wet bread, weighed down with cheese, that usually tops crocks of onion soup. Don't be surprised if these disappear before you get a chance to sample one yourself!	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Arrange slices on a large baking sheet and bake in oven until golden, about 8 minutes. Let cool.@newline@Meanwhile, heat butter and oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until butter is melted, then cook onion, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.@newline@Uncover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, about 10 to 15 minutes more. Add wine and cook until entirely evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard garlic clove, bay leaf, and thyme. Transfer to a small bowl and keep warm, covered.@newline@Preheat broiler.@newline@Arrange toasts on a large baking sheet, then top each with a rounded teaspoon of caramelized onions and sprinkle generously with shredded Gruyere. Broil 3- to 4-inches from heat until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes (watch carefully).	3
309	Chocolate Peppermint Stars	If you've been looking for a chocolate sugar cookie that doesn't wimp out, delivering the dark chocolate hit you crave, this is the one for you. The thin coating of melted bittersweet chocolate, along with a festive sprinkle of crushed candy canes, only enhances the depth of flavor inherent in the cookie's deep brown color.	Make Cookies: Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, but reduce the flour to 1 1/3 cups and add the cocoa. Whisk the flour and cocoa together.@newline@Halve dough and wrap each half in wax paper, shaping each into a flattened rectangle, then store each half in a resealable plastic bag.

Make more cookies with remaining dough. (Cool baking sheets and use fresh parchment between batches.)	4
310	Potted Crab	The delicate sweetness of Alaskan king crab is front and center in this easy-to-make appetizer. The crab legs come already cooked and need only be cracked to extract the pink-flecked succulent meat.	Crack crab shells with kitchen shears and extract meat. Cut enough crab into 1/2-inch pieces to measure 1/2 cup and transfer to a bowl.@newline@Pulse remaining crab in a food processor to finely chop (do not over process).@newline@Add to bowl with remaining ingredients and stir well. Season with salt to taste.@newline@Pack into a 1 1/2 cup crock or bowl and cover surface with plastic wrap.@newline@Chill at least 2 hours. Bring to room temperature before serving.	2
311	Raspberry-Almond Linzer Cookies	The Linzer cookie, thought to have originated in the city of Linz, is based on the Linzertorte, one of the most famous and beloved confections in Austria. The cookies are like mini versions of the torte, which consists of a buttery dough, rich with ground almonds or hazelnuts, spread with jamusually raspberry or apricot these days, but originally with black or red currant jam or jellyand then topped with a lattice of more dough before baking.p	Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@Spread almonds on a small rimmed baking sheet and bake until fragrantly toasty and nuts are golden on the inside (cut one open). Turn off oven. Cool almonds completely (you can speed this up by putting them in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes).@newline@Grind nuts with 1/2 cup of flour from cookie recipe in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour from recipe and whisk in cinnamon.@newline@Follow the rest of the Buttery Sugar Cookie dough recipe to make the Linzer dough.

Lightly dust rings (cookies with holes) with confectioners' sugar using a wire-mesh sieve.@newline@Set rings over jam to form sandwiches.	9
312	Buttery Sugar Cookies	When it comes right down to it, the simplest holiday cookie is, hands down, this sugar cookie. No rolling pin or sheets of wax paper are required. Just roll the dough into balls between your palms, then coat them with decorative coarse sugars. This is the perfect cookie for children starting out in the kitchen, by the way. They'll have loads of fun mixing up different colors of the sanding sugar, and messy kitchen aside, everyone will be happy when they sink their teeth into the first ones warm from the oven.p	Make dough: Beat together butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer (preferably fitted with paddle attachment) or 6 with a handheld. Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low, then mix in flour.@newline@Halve dough and form each half into a disk, then wrap in wax paper. Put each disk in a resealable plastic bag and chill until firm enough to roll into balls, about 1 hour.@newline@Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.	6
313	Double-Deep-Chocolate Hanukkah Layer Cake	A supermoist chocolate cake encased between layers of rich chocolate frosting is at once both a decadent treat and one of life's simple pleasures. And "simple" is an important descriptor here. Because it's an oil-based cakelike carrot cakeit doesn't involve equipment any more complicated than a whisk and a bowl.p@newline@pTwo stealth ingredients make this dessert different: unsweetened coconut milk and instant espresso powder. The former is amazing in its ability to add richness to the cake and stand in for cream in the ganache without overwhelming the dessert with coconut flavor. Espresso powder in the frosting magically highlights the depth of the chocolate.p	Bake cake layers: Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Oil pans and line bottoms with rounds of parchment, then dust sides only with cocoa powder, knocking out excess.@newline@Whisk together water, coconut milk, 3/4 cup oil, eggs, and vanilla in a bowl until well blended and smooth.@newline@Sift together flour, sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, baking powder and soda, and salt into a large bowl.

Remove parchment and cool completely.	4
314	Caramel Cheesecake Bites	If you choose to bake only one cookie from this pcollection,p make it these bites. The crisp cookie base provides the perfect contrasting setup to the luscious caramel-flavored dulce de lechecaramelized milkhidden under the creamiest cheesecake layer. The final snazzy drizzle of dulce de leche is not pessential,p we know, but it makes the bites downright irresistible.	Heat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Line a 13- by 9-inch inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang at both ends, and lightly butter.@newline@Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, but press dough evenly into bottom of pan.

Bake until cheesecake is puffed and edges are golden, 40 to 45 minutes.@newline@Cool completely in pan on a rack, then chill until cold, about 3 hours.@newline@With aid of foil overhang, lift cheesecake confection from pan.@newline@Dip a long sharp knife in a tall glass of hot water and quickly wipe it off, then trim edges of confection (save scraps for snacking). Continuing to dip knife in hot water and wiping it off before every cut, cut cheesecake lengthwise into 8 strips, then crosswise into 4 sections, to form 32 finger-shaped bites.@newline@Just before serving, if desired, arrange bites on a large rack set over a large rimmed baking sheet, spacing them apart. Put about 2/3 cup dulce de leche in disposable pastry bag, then snip off a tiny opening. Drizzle the dulce de leche in a diagonal pattern over the bites, letting it drape down the sides.	12
315	Rosemary-Crumb Beef Tenderloin with Pancetta-Roasted Tomatoes	A beef tenderloin roast is a boon for the host and a treat for family or guests during the holidays. Many big-box stores sell them at a reasonable price, and when trimmed, there's no wastejust solid meat. Cooking the roast doesn't tie up your oven for long, and once it's done, it couldn't be easier to carve. Between the green of the rosemary and the red of the grape tomatoes, the sauce is festive with color and loaded with bright flavor.	Heat oven to 500F with rack in middle.@newline@Make a deep cut into the top side of tenderloin, about 4 inches from tail end, to facilitate folding the tail end under the roast to give the meat a more uniform thickness.

Bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits, then stir in tomato mixture and parsley.@newline@Cut tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick slices, discarding string, and serve with tomato mixture.	11
316	Pink Champagne Punch	This pretty-in-pink punch is a festive and delicious way to kick-off your holiday celebration. If you prefer a punch that's less sweet, use fresh squeezed pomegranate juice instead of bottled (see Cooks' Notes).	Bring water, sugar, and lemon zest to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar, then boil 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and add pomegranate and lemon juice, then chill until very cold, at least 1 hour.@newline@Just before serving, pour pomegranate syrup into a 2-quart glass pitcher and add champagne.	1
317	Provenal Short Ribs with Olives and Herbs	Olives, garlic, herbs, tomato, and wine come together in this short rib dish, a nod to the warm and sunny flavors of Provence. A shower of freshly grated orange zest at the finale brightens the rich braised beef with a citrus zing. This recipe makes a deeply satisfying main dish for Hanukkah or any other celebratory occasion.

Let cooking liquid stand briefly, then skim fat from top. Stir in olives. Adjust seasoning to taste, if necessary.@newline@Return meat to pot. Grate zest from orange over top just before serving.	7
318	Lemony Green Beans and Peas	The play of shapes and shades of green in this vegetable combo takes the humdrum out of these supermarket standbys. Lemon zest adds just the right zip of citrus, but unlike a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, it won't turn the greens an unappealing khaki shade.p	Add green beans to a 3- to 4-quart pot of very well salted boiling water, and cook, uncovered, until barely tender, 4 to 5 minutes.@newline@Stir in peas and cook, uncovered, until beans and peas are tender, 2 to 3 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, put butter and zest in a large bowl.@newline@Drain vegetables in a sieve and add to bowl. Toss until well coated with butter and zest.@newline@Season with salt and pepper.	9
319	Best Friends Forever Brownies	After sampling hundreds of brownies in the pGourmetp magazine test kitchens, along with baking countless more at home (my first was from the cult classic pBetty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girlsp), I feel qualified to declare my pride in this brownie. It's old-fashioned in its use of unsweetened chocolate, yet the addition of cocoa takes it to the deeper, darker chocolate place we crave these days.p@newline@pNot everyone loves nuts in their brownie, but without them, brownies seem more like dense squares of chocolate cake. When you do the done test, the toothpick comes out cleanno dilemmas over the moistness of the crumbs clinging to the pickyet when you cut the brownies into pieces, you'll slice through the requisite thin crust to reveal super-moist and fudgy goodness.p	Heat oven to 325F with rack in middle.

Cut brownies into serving pieces.	9
320	Golden Scalloped Potatoes	Think of this as a streamlined and guilt-free version of scalloped potatoes. It's a toss-and-dump dish, in which I toss sliced potatoes with a little melted butter, dump them in a dish, then cover them with milkhealthier than heavy creamthat I've thickened slightly with a bit of flour (the flour keeps the milk from separating). The cheese topping is optional; with or without it, in less than an hour you will be rewarded with lusciously creamy potatoes along with that all-important browned crust.p	Heat oven to 375F with rack in middle. Butter baking dish.@newline@Peel and thinly slice potatoes into a large bowl and toss with butter. Spread potatoes in an even layer in the baking dish.@newline@Put flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a heavy medium saucepan and slowly whisk in milk until the mixture is smooth.@newline@Bring milk mixture just to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly (it will thicken slightly), and pour it over the potatoes. Cover pan tightly with foil and bake in oven until potatoes are tender, 35 to 40 minutes.@newline@Remove foil and sprinkle with cheese, if using. Reset oven to broil and broil potatoes, about 4 to 5 inches from heat, until browned and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes.	6
321	Caramel Apple Crisp	Apple crisp is one of those desserts that will never, ever go out of style. Easier than pieno pastry dough to make and roll outit delivers the warm, juicy apple love you yearn for the minute you see piles of the shiny orbs at local farmers' markets. This crisp deftly manages to capture the flavor of candied apples under a nutty, buttery crumble.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle. Butter baking dish	12
322	Grass-Fed Beef Meatloaf in a Bacon Blanket	It's good news for America that grass-fed beef is increasingly available in supermarkets. Cattle were meant to eat grass, and they are efficient at converting that green goodness into nutrient-dense meat, rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and E, to say nothing of environmental benefits. Because grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed, it's not quite as tender. So turning it into a meatloaf is a greatand economicalway to make a meal of it.p@newline@pA little ground pork adds the bit of richness that all meatloaves need, and if you can persuade the butcher to grind some pork shoulder for you, all the better. Meatloaves look naked without some sort of topping, and bacon is the obvious trendy choice to entice finicky eaters; feel free to aim for high-end bacon from heritage hogs.p	Heat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Meanwhile, stir together bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl and set aside.@newline@Cook onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in oil with 1 teaspoon salt in a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.@newline@Combine beef, pork, ketchup, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and cooked vegetables with bread crumbs and mix with your hands until vegetables are well distributed and mixture is cohesive.@newline@Form mixture into a 12-inch loaf, about 4 1/2 inches wide, in pan, and lay bacon slices crosswise over it.@newline@Roast in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 160F, 40 to 45 minutes.@newline@If the bacon on top isn't crisp, reset oven to broil and broil the meatloaf, 4 to 5 inches from the heat, until bacon is crisp and browned, 2 to 3 minutes.@newline@Let meatloaf rest in pan 10 minutes before transferring to a platter.	9
323	Pat's Deep-Fried Cornish Game Hens	I love Cornish hens: baked or smoked, but also deep-fried. To me they're like smaller turkeys, so they're perfect for entertaining smaller groups or just your family. If you can't find them at your butcher counter, check the frozen-meat sectionjust be sure to let them thaw out completely. Because of their small size, you can use an electric fryer instead of the larger turkey contraptions for deep-frying them (another bonus). Deep-fried, they've got a golden crust and a juicy, juicy tenderness. If you're short on fridge space, divide the marinade between two or three large zip-top bags, and divide the Cornish hens among them. Press the air out and seal tight; then you can fit them into a smaller space. Now, Shelbi and Gina might share a hen, so for light eaters just split one bird down the middle. But a heavy eater like me will eat a whole hen. I've been anticipating it all day!	Whisk together the first six ingredients in a small bowl. Set half of this mixture aside.@newline@Divide the remaining seasoning mixture between two large mixing bowls, and pour the buttermilk evenly between the two bowls, whisking to combine. Put half of the onion and thyme in each bowl. Place three game hens in each mixing bowl, and turn to coat. Cover the bowls with plastic wrap, and leave in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight (the longer the better; allow the seasonings and flavors to permeate the game hens).@newline@Heat the peanut oil to 375 degrees F in a large Dutch oven or deep-fryer. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees F, and cover two heavy-duty sheet trays with wire racks. Remove the game hens from the buttermilk mixture while the oil is heating.@newline@Whisk together the flour and the remaining seasoning mixture in a large casserole. Working with one game hen at a time, put one game hen in the flour and toss to coat, then shake off the excess. Slip the coated game hens, in batches according to the size of your fryer, into the hot oil, and fry for 13 minutes, until beautifully golden brown. Place each fried hen on the wire-rack-fitted sheet tray, and hold in the warm oven. Repeat with remaining hens.	2
324	Bourbon Bread Pudding	Here we go back to New Orleans again, with Bourbon Street flair. Southern bourbon-soaked brioche bread makes a hearty Creole-style dessert.	Butter a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, and put the cubed brioche in it. Sprinkle with the pecans.@newline@Whisk together the half-and-half, milk, eggs, butter, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl.@newline@Pour the custard mixture over the bread in the baking dish, giving the bread a stir to make sure it's coated. Let the pudding sit for 1 hour, so the bread can fully absorb the milk.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once it is ready, put the dish in the oven and bake for 50 minutes, or until puffy and set. Remove, and let stand 10 minutes before serving. This is absolutely lovely when served with some fresh whipped cream.	2
325	Frozen Coconut Yogurt with Cinnamon	Frozen yogurt! I mean let's face it: Everybody loves a good frozen yogurt. Adults, tweens, teens, kids, whoever. You've seen it a hundred times at your local ice cream parlor on Sunday in the summer: 9:00 p.m. and the place is packed! A line around the corner, kids playing, everybody's happy; it's the sweet life. For a diabetic, that could go two ways: One way is horribly wrong, and that's if there're no sugar-free items on the board. Or, totally great because they do offer some special items for people with some sort of dietary restriction. Or there's Plan C, which is that you make a batch of this silky, creamy, coconut yogurt at home and relax with the fam on Sunday night. Let the others rush to the corner store and wait in line; your only fear will be whether or not your family leaves you any.

326	New Orleans BBQ Shrimp	On New Year's Eve 1996, we decided we wanted a warmer place to celebrate, so we jumped on a train to New Orleans, took a paddleboat down the Mississippi, and ate dinner while watching the fireworks. The next day, there was the Sugar Bowl game and the Court of Two Sisters on Royal Street, in the French Quarter, where we went for mimosas and brunch. This routine became a tradition for a few yearsbut now it doesn't beat toasting in the year with our girls, so we brought the flavors home. This recipe holds a particularly funny memory for us. One year we had a bowl of some of these saucy, spicy shrimp at a restaurant on the pier, just before jumping on the paddleboat. Pat couldn't keep the spoon away from his mouth, and he ended up spilling a tremendous amount of that dark roux down the front of his white sweater. So there he was, sipping champagne and watching the fireworks with a huge stain! He didn't mind a bit.	Toss the shrimp with the Cajun seasoning in a medium bowl. Set aside.@newline@Heat the canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, toss in the garlic, and saut until golden, about 3 or 4 minutes. Add the shrimp to the pan, and cook until they turn bright pink, about 1 minute more. Remove the shrimp from the pan with a slotted spoon, and set aside on a plate. Pour in the beer, lemon juice, clam juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, apple-cider vinegar, bay leaves, and peppercorns; bring to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes, until the liquid is slightly thickened.@newline@Whisk the cubes of butter into the sauce, and once it's melted, add the shrimp to finish cooking, about 2 minutes more. Serve the shrimp and sauce in bowls with loads of crusty bread for dipping.	2
327	Striped Bass with Heirloom Tomato Scampi	This one is Italy, pure and simple. Which is precisely what Italian cuisine is all about: Get yourself fresh, pure ingredients in season, plus some fine, real condiments and seasonings, and put it all together without a lot of fuss, and ecco! A simply superb meal, as healthy as they come and as good as eating gets. It's also beautiful on the plate. Note that scampi does not, in fact, mean shrimp, as many people think, but rather refers to the popular lemon, garlic, and oil preparation for shrimp in so many red-sauce Italian joints.	To cook the bass: Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@In a large ovenproof nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the fish liberally with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the lemon zest and juice. Once the oil begins to shimmer, place the fillets skin-side-down in the pan and let them cook, without moving them, until the skin is crisp and golden brown, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Give a light push to loosen the skin from the pan. Add the thyme sprigs to the pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove fish from the oven and transfer to paper towels.	8

399	Ros, Bourbon, and Blue	For this patriotic-themed cooler, Cabell Tomlinson combines two summer favorites: sweet iced tea and sangria. "I started thinking about the Fourth of July," she explains. "I had the red from the ros and the blue from the blueberries. I still needed the white, but I decided to go with that oh-so-American spirit, bourbon." She uses orange pekoe for the tea and suggests a fruity ros like a Spanish Rioja.	Stir sugar with 7 tablespoons hot water in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved; transfer to a food processor.

404	Watermelon Sugar	A spicy salad of pork belly and watermelon pickle at New York City's Fatty Crab restaurant inspired bartender Philip Ward of Mayahuel to invent a liquid riff on the dish. If you're a Margarita fan, you'll love this drink, which is made with mezcal, tequila's smoky cousin. Don't mess around with the cheap stuff; look for bottles in the Del Maguey line of mezcals, including Vida de San Luis del Rio ($36).

414	Sidewalker	"I created this pitcher drink for people to sip on their front porch, or for city folks to drink at our sidewalk caf," says Damon Boelte, bar director at Prime Meats in Brooklyn. If you've never had a beer cocktail or, better yet, a cocktail made with drinking vinegars, let this be your introduction to two growing trends in the bar world. Look for Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy, a.k.a. applejack ($23), made by America's oldest family-owned distillery, at better liquor stores.	Stir first 4 ingredients in a large pitcher. Add 1 cup ice. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.@newline@Gently stir in beer and club soda. Fill 12 ounce highball glasses with ice. Divide cocktail among glasses.

419	Lemon Balm Honeysuckle	Cabell Tomlinson, bar director at Frankies 570 Spuntino in New York City, grew up in the South, where, she says, "the summer air was scented with honeysuckle and lemon balm." Those childhood memories, along with a recipe for the classic Bee's Knees cocktail (rum, lime, and honey), inspired this thirst-quencher. It's equally good with lemon vodka (try Charbay Meyer Lemon Vodka) or white rum (we like Flor de Caa Extra Dry 4 Year). Lemon balm is available at many farmers' markets. Better yet, try planting pots of the prolific herb in your backyard.	Stir honey and 6 tablespoons hot water in a large pitcher until honey is dissolved. Stir in vodka and lemon juice.

Top with fresh herbs, like chives and chervil.	9
422	Plum and Mascarpone Pie	Use plums that hold their shape when cooked, such as black or red (avoid soft-fleshed Santa Rosas). If you prefer a taller pie, use all 5 pounds of fruit.	Preheat oven to 350F. Line pie dish with crust; crimp edges. Fully bake pie crust according to recipe or box instructions.@newline@Place plums in a large bowl; add 1 1/2 cups sugar and lemon juice. Scrape in seeds from half of vanilla bean; toss to coat. Divide plum mixture between two 13x9x2" glass baking dishes, arranging plums cut side down and overlapping slightly.

423	Peach Dutch Baby Pancake with Cherry Compote	This puffy, souffl-like pancake is just as good for dessert as it is for breakfast. Don't worry when it deflates as soon as it's removed from the oven; that's exactly what's supposed to happen, forming a well for the cherry compote. Serve it immediately, right from the skillet.	For compote: Bring honey, lemon peel, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small heavy saucepan. Add cherries and simmer briskly, stirring occasionally, until sauce is syrupy, about 15 minutes. Transfer cherry compote to a medium bowl and chill. DO AHEAD: Compote can be made 1 day ahead.

425	The Ultimate Brownie Sundae	Chocolate has the incredible ability to stand alone quite nicely while playing along with loads of other prominent ingredientswithout being a bully. And that is why a brownie sundae can be so frustrating: How can you settle on one ice cream flavor or a single sauce?p@newline@We figured Father's Day is the right time to have a brownie sundae pyourp way. Dads have soft spots for cuteness, so serving up a brownie raft supporting mini-scoops of three different ice creams adrift in three different sauces will tickle him to no end. Feel free to use whatever ice cream flavors are the family favorites.p	Put brownie strips on each of 6 plates and top with small scoops (or curls) of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee ice cream, arranged side by side. Spoon your sauce of choice over each scoop of ice cream.	7

Coat them with chocolate and sprinkle them with homemade peanut brittlethere will be plenty left over for snackingand you've got a refreshingly cold treat that feels almost as virtuous as a serving of fruit.p	Line a large baking sheet with wax paper.@newline@Peel bananas and carefully insert a popsicle stick into bottom end of each banana, halfway up stick. Arrange bananas on the baking sheet and freeze until firm but not frozen hard, about 1 hour. (You don't want the bananas so cold that the chocolate solidifies before you have a chance to add the peanut brittle.)	11
427	Fried Onion Dippers with Balsamic Ketchup	Don't say we didn't warn you! Once you taste our batter-fried onion dippers, those blooming onions and onion rings you've always loved will seem so yesterday.

430	Grilled Rib Pork Chops with Sweet and Tangy Peach Relish	A 1-inch-thick rib pork chop is big enough to take a commanding spot on the plate but not so big as to overwhelm it, or turn into a belly-bomb once consumed. Although you don't have to brine the chops, this brine works quickly and it's worth it for the juiciness and flavor it imparts to the meat. And nothing telegraphs summer and celebrations like peaches. Their fruity tang, along with the colorful strips of red onion, helps deliver porcine satisfaction. You need nothing more than some steamed green beans or sugar snap peas and a big green salad.p	Make Brine: In a wide 6- to 8-quart pot whisk together 8 cups water, salt, and sugar until salt and sugar are dissolved.@newline@Add pork chops to brine and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.@newline@Prepare grill for direct-heat grilling over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas; see Grilling Procedure below).@newline@Remove pork chops from brine, discarding brine, and pat chops dry with several layers of paper towels. Season chops with pepper.@newline@Oil grill rack, then grill chops, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally and moving around if flare-ups occur, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes total.@newline@Move chops to area with no coals underneath (if using gas, turn off a burner and move chops to area over shut-off burner) then cover with lid, and grill, turning and brushing with liquid, until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chop as close to bone without touching it registers 145F for slightly pink meat, about 2 to 3 minutes longer.@newline@Transfer chops to a platter and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.@newline@Serve chops with peach relish.	1
431	Persian Rice	The browned, crusty layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan is considered the most treasured part of this Middle Eastern classic.	Place rice in a medium saucepan; add 2 teaspoons salt and cold water to cover by 2". Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain rice, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.@newline@Place saffron and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid in a small bowl; let saffron soften for 5 minutes. Place yogurt in a medium bowl and stir in remaining 1 teaspoon salt and saffron water.

434	The Silkiest Carbonara	At Pirelli's restaurant in Rome, chef Barbara Lynch ate what was, for her, the perfect carbonara: The sauce was bright yellow from fresh eggs, and each rigatoni hid cubes of fatty guanciale. In Boston, where Lynch has five restaurants, she set out to master the dish. Her yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamywithout cream!with a heady mix of peppercorns (you can substitute black pepper for all and it's still great). It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? She omits most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. Too much cheese overthickens it, so she gradually adds Pecorino while tossing the pasta until she hits the right consistency (the sauce should be loose enough to drag the pasta through). Lynch was right: It's a pasta worth mastering.	Put guanciale in a large skillet and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until fat renders but guanciale is not browned, about 5 minutes. Pour into a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl; reserve drippings. Transfer guanciale to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Add egg yolks and egg to bowl; whisk to blend.@newline@Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.@newline@To egg mixture, immediately add rigatoni, 2 tablespoons pasta cooking liquid, and 1 teaspoon guanciale drippings; toss to coat. Working in 3 batches, gradually add Pecorino, stirring and tossing to melt between batches. Add green, pink, and white pepper (or 1 1/2-2 teaspoons black pepper); toss until sauce thickens, adding more pasta water by tablespoonfuls if needed. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.@newline@Divide among bowls. Garnish with Pecorino.	9
435	Vanilla Cloverleaf Sweet Rolls	A simple addition to the master dough results in deliciously scented rolls.	Follow directions for Master Sweet Dough, scraping in seeds from vanilla bean as directed.@newline@Coat muffin pan cups with melted butter. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll half of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12"-long log (cover remaining dough with plastic wrap). Cut log into 6 equal pieces. Cut 1 piece into 3 equal pieces. Roll each third into a 1" ball by cupping your hand and pushing dough against work surface as you roll it in a circular motion. Place 3 balls side by side in 1 muffin cup. Repeat with remaining pieces, then with remaining half of dough.@newline@Loosely cover pan with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let sit in a warm, draft-free area until dough rises about 1" above rim of muffin pan, 1-1 1/2 hours.@newline@Arrange a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375F. Brush tops of rolls with milk, then sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.@newline@Bake until puffed and golden brown, 18-20 minutes. Transfer rolls to a wire rack; let cool, 10-20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Let cool completely. Store airtight in freezer for up to 1 month. Let thaw at room temperature.

438	The Loftiest Souffl	Here's a souffl that can stand up for itself. Michel Richard, of Citronelle in Washington, D.C., ignores tales about souffls that collapse when the oven is opened (a myth). Instead, he focuses on what matters: a well-seasoned base that infuses the souffl with flavor, and properly whipped whites that achieve optimum volume as they bake. Whip the whites until firm, but stop before they get too stiff, says Richard, or the souffl will be grainy. And quell your jitters with his 21st-century trick: Add xanthan gum to the whites. It acts as a stabilizer resulting in the most dramatic souffl we've made in a while.	Preheat oven to 400F. Brush ramekins with butter and place on a foil-lined baking sheet; sprinkle ramekins with 2 tablespoons Parmesan (total). Chill for 20 minutes or, covered, up to 1 day.@newline@Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; whisk constantly for 30 seconds. Gradually whisk in milk; increase heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Add remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1/2 cup Gruyre; stir until melted. Add nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Transfer bchamel to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap; set aside.@newline@Place egg whites in a large bowl. Stir in a pinch of salt and xanthan gum, if using. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until firm but not stiff, 3-4 minutes.@newline@Stir egg yolks into bchamel. Gently stir in 1/4 of beaten egg whites to loosen bchamel base, then gently fold in remaining egg whites just to combine, taking care not to deflate.@newline@Divide mixture among ramekins; sprinkle with 1/2 cup Gruyre. Run your finger around inside lip of ramekins, cleaning edges. Bake until souffls rise, centers are set, and cheese is golden brown, 18-22 minutes. Serve immediately.	12
439	Spiced Carrots	Ras-el-hanout, meaning "head of the shop," is a complex North African spice mixture that imparts a blend of aromatic, spicy, and earthy flavors.	Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ras-el-hanout, if using, and curry powder; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Add carrots; cook, stirring often, until still slightly firm to the bite, 6-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add broth; simmer until all liquid is absorbed and carrots are tender, 6-7 minutes longer.	6
440	Hot-and-Sour Peanutty Noodles with Bok Choy	Traditional Asian meals tend to be full of veggies, and this one won't disappoint. Also, peanuts provide protein and off-the-chart levels of resveratrol, the same heart-smart compound found in red wine.	Cook pasta as directed on package with 2 teaspoons salt until just tender. Drain and rinse pasta with cool water. In a large nonstick skillet, heat canola oil over medium-high heat. Cook shallot and ginger, stirring, until just brown, 1 minute. Add bok choy stems, bell pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until peppers are crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer contents of skillet to a plate. To same skillet, add bok choy leaves, stock, soy sauce, sesame oil and vinegar. Cook, stirring, until leaves are soft and bright green, 1 to 2 minutes.

Cover and shake vigorously until well combined. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.	5
442	Creamy Fettuccine with Peas and Basil	Satisfy a hankering for high-fat Alfredo sauce with this light, no-dairy version. Oat milk and cashew butter stand in for heavy cream, keeping calories and saturated fat low.	In a bowl, whisk oat milk, cashew butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt until big lumps disappear. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook garlic, stirring, until golden, 1 minute. Stir in milk mixture; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until thick and fragrant, 2 minutes. Stir in peas; turn off heat. Cook pasta as directed on package with remaining 1 teaspoon salt until just tender. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Heat milk and pea mixture over low heat for 2 minutes. Toss in pasta; add cooking water as needed to thin sauce to desired thickness; toss to thoroughly coat pasta. Garnish with basil and black pepper; serve.	10
443	The Creamiest Aioli	Think of this aioli as your secret sauce. Made by transforming egg yolks, garlic, and olive oil into a creamy dip, it's Provence's answer to mayonnaise. The secret is creating a tight emulsion of the yolk and oil. The technique, thankfully, is less scientific: "Add a thin drizzle of oil and whisk like crazy," says Suzanne Goin, chef at L.A.'s Lucques, Tavern, and A.O.C. Her version lets the egg shine by using half flavor-neutral grapeseed oil so the olive oil doesn't dominate. The result is a harmonious sauce with a supple texture (thanks to hand-whisking instead of using a blender) that begs to be spooned onto meat, bread, and fish. Goin serves it with salmon and poached spring vegetables, but no matter what you pair it with, this sauce is the star.	Drape a kitchen towel over a small saucepan; set a small metal bowl over (this will hold bowl in place). Whisk egg yolk*, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 teaspoons water in metal bowl to blend well. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in grapeseed oil, 1 teaspoonful at a time, until sauce is thickened and emulsified. Whisking constantly, add olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Stir in cayenne; season aioli with lemon juice, pepper, and salt.	9
444	Watercress Soup	The success of this simple soup depends on using the freshest watercress available. Choose the full-grown, thick-stemmed variety; it has more of the green's characteristic bold, peppery flavor.	Melt butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5-6 minutes. Add broth and potatoes; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.@newline@Add watercress to pot; stir until leaves wilt. Let soup cool briefly. Working in batches, pure soup in a blender until smooth. Return soup to same pot. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.@newline@Whisk cream with a pinch of salt in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Fold in 1 1/2 tablespoons chives.@newline@Rewarm soup gently over low heat. Divide soup among demitasse or small teacups and garnish each cup with a dollop of whipped cream. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons chives over.	10
445	Pan-Roasted Rib Eyes	Steaks this thick need a two-step cooking process. Give them a good sear on the stove-top, then transfer them to the oven to allow the inside to finish cooking without burning the outside. Ask your butcher to french the bones by removing excess fat and muscle, if desired.	Preheat oven to 400F. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper; let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Scatter thyme and rosemary sprigs evenly in bottom of a roasting pan; dot with 4 tablespoons butter.@newline@Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and add 1 steak to skillet. Cook until seared and golden brown on all sides (including edges), 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer steak to prepared roasting pan. Pour out oil and wipe skillet with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon oil, and steak.@newline@Roast steaks in oven, turning halfway through cooking and basting frequently with herb butter in pan, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into steak registers 125F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes, or to desired doneness.@newline@Transfer steaks to a cutting board. Drizzle 1 tablespoon herb butter from roasting pan over each steak and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice against the grain and divide among plates. Don't forget to set out the bones for those who like to gnaw on them. Serve with Barnaise Sauce.	11
446	The Ultimate Sticky Buns	These buns can be assembled the night before, needing only a final rise before baking.	For topping: Preheat oven to 350F. Spread out nuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until fragrant and slightly darkened, 10-12 minutes. Let cool completely. Set 1 1/4 cups nuts aside for buns.@newline@Melt butter in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar, cream, honey, salt, and orange zest, if using. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until glaze is golden brown and glossy, 3-4 minutes. Pour 1 cup of glaze into baking pan, tilting to coat bottom and sides. Set aside remaining glaze. Sprinkle 1/2 cup toasted pecans over bottom of baking pan and let cool.	11
447	Spring Vegetable and Goat Cheese Dip	Everything I know about getting a party started right, I learned at Houston's restaurant in Atlanta. No kidding. Its creamy, bubbling spinach and artichoke dip was a must on date night in high school, and these days it's pthep dish that even the snobbiest of food snobs can't resist. I'll whip it up for friends and, no matter what else I serve, it's always the first thing to go. Sometimes I leave out the spinach, add red pepper flakes, or use whatever vegetable is in season. In other words, it stands up to improvisation. We've put a spring spin on the dish, starring asparagus, just-dug-up leeks, sweet peas, and fresh goat cheese. Serve it with crostini, tortilla chips, or crudits. Or just eat it by the spoonful. It's that good.p	Preheat oven to 450F. Cook asparagus in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain; let cool.@newline@Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add leeks and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 10 minutes. Whisk in flour; gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened; remove from heat. Add cheddar; whisk until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold in asparagus (reserve tips), artichoke hearts, peas, chives, mint, flat-leaf parsley, zest and 2 ounces crumbled fresh goat cheese.@newline@Transfer mixture to a 4-5-cup baking dish; arrange asparagus tips on top and dot with another 2 ounces goat cheese. Bake until golden brown and bubbling, 15-20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.	11
448	Black Bean Tacos with Corn Salsa	Where's the beef? Who cares? The spiced beans in these festive folds contain fiber, a blood sugar regulator that fends off cravings, as well as protein, which builds lean muscle. Satisfied taste buds and a trimmer youcheck and check!	Heat oven to 400F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a food processor, chop garlic. Add beans, oats, cornmeal, chili powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; process, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides, until mixture is combined, 1 minute. Crumble bean mixture with hands, sprinkle on prepared sheet, and coat with cooking spray. Bake until firm and crisp on bottom, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a spoon to break up pieces, coat with cooking spray, and bake until crisp all over, 10 to 15 minutes. Stack tortillas and wrap in foil; warm in oven 5 minutes. In a bowl, combine corn, bell pepper, chile, scallions and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; sprinkle with lime juice. Divide bean crumble among tortillas; top with corn salsa and cilantro.	2
449	Matzo Brei	NoDescription	Break 2 sheets of matzo into 1/2" pieces; place in a medium bowl. Cover with very hot tap water. Let stand for about 30 seconds, then drain. Beat 2 large eggs in another medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add drained matzo; mix until combined and a wet batter forms. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spoon scant 1/4-cupfuls of batter into skillet, making 4 pancakes. Fry, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Serve with jam, syrup, or whatever the hell you'd like. These rock.	7
450	Easter Ham with Golden Breadcrumbs and Madeira Sauce	The truth is, you can use any supermarket bone-in ham for this recipe, or buy a half ham and cut the recipe accordingly. But considering the holiday occasion, it's worthwhile to get the best cured, smoked, bone-in ham you can find. Special-order one from your butcher or from dartagnan.com (we love their applewood-smoked version).	Arrange a rack on lowest level of oven; preheat to 300F. Without trimming fat, remove outer rind from most of ham, leaving a band around end of shank bone. Spacing cuts 3/4" apart to make a diamond pattern, score fat on top of ham crosswise and then lengthwise on a diagonal (do not cut into meat). Place ham in a large roasting pan. Pour 3 cups water into pan and roast ham for 2 hours.@newline@Meanwhile, stir brown sugar and mustard in a medium bowl until a thick paste forms; set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs; toast, stirring often, until very crispy, 5-7 minutes. Set aside.@newline@Remove ham from oven; increase temperature to 350F.

Fill a cocktail shaker halfway full with ice cubes. Add the molasses, port, and Goldschlger. Shake until cold.@newline@2. Strain into four old-fashioned glasses. Top with the oatmeal stout, and serve.	12
460	Bloodied Belgian	Here's a take on the classic Blood and Sand cocktail, using Flemish-style sour ale or pkriekp (which means "cherry") lambic instead of cherry liqueur. Lambic is a distinctively Belgian style of beer, made with wild yeast as opposed to the carefully controlled fermentation of conventional ales. It is often flavored with fruit, such as cherries or raspberries. Thanks to Eben Freeman, who serves a version of this drink at Ai Fiori in New York City.	1. Fill a cocktail shaker halfway full with ice cubes. Add the Scotch, vermouth, and blood orange juice and shake until blended.@newline@2. Strain into a cocktail glass. Top with the ale, drop in the cherries for garnish, and serve.	2
461	Maru	Maru is the name of the adorable Japanese cat whose love of jumping into and out of boxes has inspired us to waste many happy hours drinking beer in front of our computer when we should have been working instead. This cocktail has the popular Japanese lager Sapporo as its base, a crisp and well-carbonated brew that is typically paired with sushi. Here, the slight bitterness of the beer is tempered by tart berries and mandarin oranges.	1. Muddle the blackberries in the bottom of a cocktail shaker. Fill the shaker halfway full with ice cubes, add the mandarin orange juice, Chambord, and St-Germain, and shake vigorously.@newline@2. Strain into four goblets or wine glasses, top with the Sapporo, and serve.	8
462	Lemon-Pepper Salt Rub	Sprinkle this fresh take on lemon-pepper seasoning over olive oil-rubbed chicken or steak before grilling or roasting. It's also delicious strewn over grilled or pan-roasted cod or bluefish.	Finely crush whole black peppercorns in a spice mill. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in lemon zest and kosher salt. Rub seasoning between your fingertips to break up any clumps of zest. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.	1
463	Shrimp, Lobster, and Jicama Salad	Trust us: No one will complain if you double the shrimp and omit the lobster in this tart and beachy seafood salad. Just be sure to sear the shrimp quickly on a hot grill: The char plays nicely with lime juice.	Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. If using shell-on shrimp, use small scissors to cut shells along the curved backs. Remove veins, keeping shells intact. Place shrimp and lobster in a large bowl; drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt. Mix onion and 2 tablespoons lime juice in a small bowl.@newline@Grill shrimp until just opaque in center, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Grill lobster tails, flesh side down, until slightly charred, 1-2 minutes. Turn flesh side up and grill until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes longer. Add lobster tails to plate with shrimp and let rest for 5-10 minutes. Remove lobster meat from shells; discard shells. Cut lobster into 1" pieces.@newline@Drain red onion; place in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons lime juice, 2 tablespoons oil, jicama, greens, tomatillos, and 1 cup cilantro. Season with salt and more lime juice, if desired. Add seafood; toss to coat. Drizzle Ancho Chile Oil over; garnish with cilantro.	9
464	Grilled Steak Salad with Tomato Vinaigrette	A great summer salad requires three things: fresh greens, a tart, seasonal dressing (made here with grated tomato), and a light hand to toss the ingredients together so the lettuces stay perky.	Season steak with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper; set aside. Grate cut sides of tomato on coarse holes of a box grater into a medium bowl down to the skin; discard skin. Add shallot and vinegar; whisk in 1/4 cup oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. DO AHEAD: Tomato vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Toss spring onions in a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill onions until just tender, 2-3 minutes per side.

Transfer to a cutting board. Let rest, about 10 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, make croutons: Brush both sides of bread slices with remaining 4 teaspoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill bread until dark golden brown and nicely charred in spots, about 2 minutes per side. Set toast aside until cool enough to handle, then break toast into roughly 1" pieces.@newline@Thinly slice steak against the grain. Toss lettuces, basil, spring onions, croutons, and some of the vinaigrette in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add steak and toss gently to coat. Serve with remaining vinaigrette alongside.	9
465	Surfer's Granola	Packed with oats, nuts, and seeds, this energy booster can be made up to 1 week ahead. Serve it as a snack, or for breakfast with yogurt and any kind of seasonal fresh fruit.	Heat oven to 300F. Mix oats, millet and flaxseeds (if using), 1/4 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, and ginger in a medium bowl. Add 1 cup hot tap water. Mix thoroughly and let stand for 15 minutes to soften oats.@newline@Bring honey, 2 tablespoons oil, and brown sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar.

466	Japanese-Style Seasoning Salt	This is our version of pshichimi togaraship, the spicy Japanese condiment.	Grind toasted, crumbled nori sheets in a spice mill to a fine powder. Add toasted sesame seeds, finely grated zest of tangerines or lemons, kosher salt, toasted Sichuan peppercorns, ground ginger, paprika, toasted white or black poppy seeds, and cayenne pepper; pulse to a uniform spice blend but not to a powder. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.	1
467	The BA Burger Deluxe	Five ingredients and five steps will get you to burger heaven.	Divide meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Place 1 portion on a work surface. Cup your hands around the meat and begin to gently shape it into a rounded mound. (Use light pressure as you shape so you don't pack the meat too tightly.) Lightly press down on the top of the meat with your palm to gently flatten it. Continue rotating and cupping the meat, patting the top of it occasionally, until you've formed a 4"-diameter, 3/4"-thick patty. Using your thumb, make a small indentation in the center to help keep the burger flat as it cooks. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining portions.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Season one side of patties with salt and pepper; place on grill, seasoned side down. Grill until lightly charred on bottom, about 4 minutes. Season other side, turn, and top with cheese. Grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes longer for medium. Transfer burgers to buns and let stand for 3 minutes before serving.	2
468	Cold-Brew Iced Coffee Concentrate	For a clear liquid, use coarsely ground coffee. (Finely ground beans make for a cloudier drink.)	Place ground coffee in a large container. Gradually add 7 cups cold water. Stir gently to be sure all grounds are moistened. Cover with a layer of cheesecloth. Let stand at room temperature for 15 hours.@newline@Remove cheesecloth and use it to line a fine-mesh sieve set over a large pitcher. Pour coffee through sieve into pitcher (do not stir); rinse jar and set aside. Discard cheesecloth with solids.@newline@Line same sieve with a large coffee filter and set over reserved jar. Strain coffee through sieve into jar. (It may take up to 45 minutes for all of the coffee to drip through; do not stir or coffee may become cloudy.) Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Coffee concentrate can be made 2 weeks ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Fill a glass with ice. Dilute 1 part coffee concentrate with 1 part milk, if desired, or water.	7
469	Steak Skewers with Scallion Dipping Sauce	Pelaccio flips the kebab script by cubing luxurious cuts of steak and marinating them in coconut milk, garlic, and chiles. Try this with tri-tip, top sirloin cap steak, or rib eye; just make sure a strip of fat is still intact; you'll use it to thread onto the skewers.	For meat and marinade: Pure all ingredients except steak in a blender or a food processor until smooth. Trim strip of fat (sometimes called a fat cap) from meat. Cut fat into 1/4"-1/2" cubes; cut meat into approximately 1" cubes. Place fat and meat in a large bowl. Add marinade and toss to coat; cover and chill overnight.@newline@Remove fat and meat from marinade, brushing off excess. Thread onto skewers, alternating meat with fat, so that pieces are touching but not pressed tightly together (which would slow down cooking). Leave at least 1" of space at the ends of skewers for easy turning. Discard marinade; save excess fat for basting liquid.	6
470	Melon Carpaccio with Lime	Try this refreshing dessert with other firm, ripe fruit, including pineapple, peaches, or plums. Chill any leftover syrup for sweetening iced tea or cocktails.	Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add mint sprigs and chile. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Remove syrup from heat; cover and let steep for 15 minutes for flavors to infuse.@newline@Strain syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; stir in lime juice. DO AHEAD: Syrup can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Arrange melon slices in a 13x9x2" glass baking dish. Pour syrup over melon in baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours to allow flavors to meld.@newline@Divide melon slices among plates, overlapping them decoratively. Pour remaining syrup in dish into a small pitcher. DO AHEAD: Melon carpaccio can be made up to 5 hours ahead. Cover and chill melon and remaining syrup separately.@newline@Drizzle some of syrup over melon. Place a scoop of sorbet in center of each plate, if using; garnish with mint leaves and lime zest.	6
471	Grilled Shrimp with Chile, Cilantro, and Lime	You bought the freshest-looking shrimp, baby squid, or whole fish you could find. Now what? Follow Pelaccio's road map for any kind of seafood: Marinate it in turmeric and fish sauce, grill it quickly over high heat, then pair it with a fiery dipping sauce.	Combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 tablespoons oil, and turmeric in a large bowl; toss to coat. Let stand for 30 minutes.@newline@Pure 4 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 tablespoons oil, cilantro, and remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor until a coarse mixture forms; transfer dipping sauce to a small bowl and set aside.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Oil grill grates. Shake excess liquid from shrimp and place shrimp on grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until shrimp are charred and cooked through, 5-6 minutes.@newline@Serve immediately with sauce.	4
472	Coffee S'mores Pie	This sophisticated mashup of the campfire classic uses Nutella to bind the graham cracker crust and coffee to deepen the chocolate flavor in the rich ganache filling.	For graham cracker crust: Mix graham cracker crumbs and remaining ingredients in a small bowl to blend. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of pie dish; chill until crust is firm, about 30 minutes.	3
473	Mixed Berry Gazpacho with Basil	Michael Laiskonis uses a little sugar and the gentle heat of a double boiler to draw out the berries' juices without cooking them, yielding a vibrant sweet soup.	Combine first 6 ingredients and basil sprig in a medium heatproof bowl; toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Place over a large saucepan of simmering water; cook for 10 minutes.@newline@Let cool for 15 minutes. Chill until cold, about 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Berry gazpacho can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Divide fruit and juices among bowls; drizzle with oil, garnish with basil leaves and pepper, and top with a scoop of ice cream.	11
474	Grilled Turmeric and Lemongrass Chicken Wings	Cooking the wings slowly over medium-low coals and turning them often makes for crisp results; the skin will brown while the meat cooks through. Be sure to begin 1 day ahead; the chicken needs to marinate overnight for the flavors to infuse.	Combine coconut milk, shallots, garlic, lemongrass, jalapeos, ginger, lime juice, tamarind juice, fish sauce, kosher salt, turmeric, and 1 cup water in a blender. Pure mixture until a smooth marinade forms.@newline@Place chicken wings in a large baking dish. Pour marinade over; turn wings to coat evenly. Cover chicken and chill overnight.@newline@Remove chicken from marinade, shaking any excess marinade back into dish. Transfer chicken to a large platter. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.@newline@Transfer marinade to a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until marinade thickens, 10-15 minutes. Pour half of marinade into a small bowl; set aside for basting chicken while it grills. Keep remaining marinade in saucepan; cover and keep warm until ready to serve the chicken.@newline@Build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Oil grill grates to prevent sticking. Grill chicken wings, turning every 5 minutes and basting occasionally with marinade in small bowl, until fat is rendered and skin is nicely charred in spots, 30-35 minutes. (The key here is to turn the wings often so the skin doesn't burn.)@newline@Continue cooking chicken without basting (so it will get crisp) until wings are cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.@newline@Transfer chicken to a large platter and let it rest for 5 minutes. Squeeze lime wedges over wings. Transfer marinade in saucepan to a small bowl. Serve warm marinade alongside chicken as a dipping sauce.	6
475	Cheesecake with Ginger-Lime Candied Raspberries	You may never bake a cheesecake again; Laiskonis sets his super-light filling with gelatin instead of eggs and flavors it with a refreshing hit of citrus.	For shortbread crust: Lightly coat an 8x8x2" baking pan with nonstick spray; line with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang.@newline@Mix crumbs, butter, and salt in a medium bowl until it resembles moist sand. Press evenly onto bottom of pan. Cover; chill.	8
476	Jalapeo Tequila Gimlet	Forget the mezcal. Use this chile-infused tequila in Margaritas and Palomassalt-rimmed cocktails made with tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda.	Grill, broil, or roast jalapeos over a gas flame, turning frequently, until soft and charred. Stem and chop chiles.@newline@Transfer chiles and seeds, if using, to a jar. Add tequila and let sit for 1 hour. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium pitcher; discard solids in sieve. Stir in lime juice, agave syrup, and 2 cups ice (to chill and dilute). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until ice is melted. Divide gimlet among chilled glasses.	11
477	Strawberry-Hibiscus Granita	Want the fluffiest ice? Scrape the frozen mixture with a fork every 30 minutes to create smaller crystals.	Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in hibiscus and basil sprig. Remove from heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Cover and chill hibiscus tea until cold, at least 1 hour.@newline@Meanwhile, blend quartered strawberries in a blender until finely pured. Transfer to a large bowl; add tea, agave syrup, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Season to taste, adding more agave and lime juice, if desired.@newline@Pour strawberry mixture into a 13x9x2" metal pan and freeze until top layer begins to harden, about 2 hours. Using a fork, scrape mixture to break frozen portions into tiny pieces. Freeze for 30 minutes; scrape again. Repeat until granita resembles fluffy shaved ice, about 4 hours.@newline@Divide among bowls. Garnish with basil leaves and diced strawberries.	4
478	Chocolate Semifreddo with Chile-Chocolate Sauce	The keys to a light, airy semifreddo that melts in your mouth? Just enough sugar to sweeten it and keep it soft in the freezer. Also, "gently folding and not overmixing," says Laiskonis. Go over the top by serving it with cinnamon whipped cream and chile-chocolate sauce (or use store- bought chocolate sauce).	For semifreddo: Spray a 9x4 1/2 x 3" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with plastic wrap, leaving a 2" overhang; set aside. Whisk egg whites and sugar in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water until sugar dissolves and egg whites are warm (but not hot), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium-high speed until cool, tripled in volume, and stiff peaks form, about 8 minutes. (If egg whites look grainy, you've gone too far.)@newline@Stir chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl over same saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth; remove from heat; let cool slightly.@newline@Beat cream in another medium bowl until medium-stiff peaks form (cream should be soft and pillowy; peaks will just fall onto themselves). Using a rubber spatula, gently fold egg whites into warm chocolate. Fold in whipped cream. (Stop folding as soon as mixture becomes one smooth texture and light brown color.) Scrape semifreddo into prepared pan; smooth top. Cover tightly and freeze until firm, 3-4 hours. DO AHEAD: Semifreddo can be made 5 days ahead. Keep tightly wrapped and frozen.	6
479	Chicken Under a Brick with Avocados and Chiles	This technique encourages even cooking with the crispiest skin imaginable. The key to success is to cook the chicken over medium-low coals so the skin slowly renders out the fat. As for those grilled avocados, you're in for a treat. They're already our go-to side this summer.	Open chicken and place on a work surface, skin side up. Using your palms, firmly press on breastbone to flatten the breast. Season chicken all over with 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne. Place in a baking dish; rub with 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with lemon zest, and scatter rosemary over. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.@newline@Build a medium-low fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium. Place chicken, skin side down, on grill and place a brick or heavy skillet on top of chicken to weigh it down. (This will expose more skin to direct heat, making it crispy; the chicken will also cook faster.) Cook until skin is crispy and golden brown, about 15 minutes.@newline@Using tongs, set brick aside. Turn chicken, cover grill, and cook for 10 more minutes. Continue cooking and turning chicken every 10 minutes, covering grill between turns, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165F, about 50 minutes total. Transfer to a carving board; let chicken rest for 10-20 minutes. (Resting will make for juicier meat.)@newline@While chicken rests, add more coals to fire if necessary to increase heat to medium, or heat gas grill to medium-high. Season chile, bell pepper, and onion with salt and pepper. Grill (or use a grill basket) over medium heat, turning occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, about 12 minutes. Transfer onion to a medium bowl. Transfer chiles and peppers to a work surface and cut lengthwise into 1" slices. Add to bowl with onion. Add 1/4 cup vinegar to vegetables and toss to coat.@newline@Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add basil and stir to wilt. Add basil mixture to bowl with onion. Season vegetables to taste with salt and more vinegar, if desired.@newline@Rub cut side of avocados with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt, and sprinkle with chili powder. Grill, cut side down, until avocado is gently warmed and flesh is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Serve chicken with vegetables and avocados.	12
480	Apricot Rice Pudding Pops	Thai-flavored rice pudding is frozen into creamy ice pops. Dried apricots add subtle color and a satisfyingly chewy texture.	Combine milk, coconut milk, cream, lemongrass, ginger, and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a boil; remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 15 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, place rice and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl; let stand for 10 minutes (to soften and release some starch). Drain.@newline@Strain coconut-milk mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium saucepan. Add rice; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer (do not stir or rice will become too starchy) until rice is very tender, 30-35 minutes. Let cool slightly.@newline@Stir in apricots and sugar. Divide mixture among ice-pop molds. Freeze until beginning to set, 30-45 minutes. Insert a stick into each pop. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour longer. DO AHEAD: Pops can be made 2 weeks ahead. Keep frozen.	6
481	Frise and Radish Salad with Hazelnut Dressing	This riff on the classic frise salad with lardons is the perfect thing to make with leftover hazelnuts from our 10 Minute Main pHake with Hazelnuts and Capersp . It looks delicate, but its vinaigrette is enriched with the nuts and some bacon fat, which not only gives it substance but also balances the bitterness of the frise and the bite of the radishes.	Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add hazelnuts and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly in skillet.@newline@Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain and reserve 1 tablespoon bacon fat. Break bacon into 1-inch pieces.@newline@Pure hazelnuts (with any remaining cooking oil), vinegar, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining vegetable oil, and reserved bacon fat in a blender just until nuts are finely chopped (dressing will be thick and slightly chunky).@newline@Toss frise, radishes, and bacon with dressing.	10
482	Rosemary and Garlic Roasted Potatoes	Rosemary's piney scent is so particular you could never mistake it for any other herb. A handful of sprigs (left over from pBeef Sauted with White Wine and Rosemaryp ) mingle with garlic to cast a spell over roasted potatoes, resulting in something that's just right on a winter night.	Preheat oven to 450F with a 4-sided heavy sheet pan in upper third.@newline@Toss ingredients with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread in 1 layer on hot pan and roast 20 minutes. Loosen potatoes with a metal spatula and turn, arranging pale potatoes around outer edge of pan and golden potatoes in center (for even roasting). Roast 15 minutes, then loosen and turn potatoes over again. Roast until potatoes are golden and cooked through and edges are crisp, about 10 minutes more.	4
483	Golden Raisin Oat Bran Muffins	"America needs more bran," says food editor Ian Knauer. It's hard to argue when your mouth is full of one of his crumbly, deliciously buttery bran muffins. Golden raisins add sunny bursts to this healthful snack.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle. Butter muffin pan.@newline@Whisk together flour, oat bran, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl.@newline@In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, honey, butter, and eggs. Add to dry ingredients along with raisins and stir until just combined.@newline@Divide batter among muffin cups. Bake until a wooden pick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool.	12
484	Calamari-Olive Salad	This beautiful seafood salad makes a terrific home for leftover Nioise olives from the braised pVeal Cacciatorep . Quickly cooking the calamari renders it snowy white and very tendersuch a nice backdrop to the salty olives and crunchy celery. Scallion, lemon zest, and celery add freshness.	Rinse squid under cold running water, then pat dry between paper towels. Halve tentacles lengthwise and cut bodies (including flaps, if attached) crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide rings. Cook in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 3 quarts water), uncovered, until just opaque, 30 to 40 seconds. Drain and immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop cooking. When squid is cool, drain and pat dry.@newline@Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add squid and toss until combined well. Serve chilled or at room temperature.	12
485	Amaretti Tiramisu	We use amaretti crumbs to line the pan of this pRicotta Cheesecakep . In a twist on classic tiramisu, the leftover almond-flavored macaroons assume a more prominent role: Layered with an airy mascarpone mousse, they take the place of the traditional ladyfingers.	Beat together yolks and 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Beat in mascarpone until just combined.@newline@Beat whites with salt in another large bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks. Add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, a little at a time, beating, then continue to beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.@newline@Beat cream in another bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks. Gently but thoroughly fold cream into mascarpone mixture, then fold mixture into whites.@newline@Pour espresso into a shallow bowl. Dip half of amaretti (15 to 20) in espresso for about 20 seconds, turning to coat both sides and letting excess drip off. Arrange in 1 layer in an 8-inch square baking dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture evenly over amaretti. Make another layer in same manner with remaining amaretti (dipped in espresso) and mascarpone mixture. Chill at least 6 hours.	4
486	Mrs. O'Callaghan's Soda Bread	At Ballinalacken Castle Country House & Restaurant, the bread is baked in a rectangular pan.	Preheat oven to 425F. Spray heavy baking sheet with nonstick spray. Whisk both flours, sugar, and baking soda in medium bowl to blend. Add margarine and cut in until margarine is reduced to pea-size pieces. Add buttermilk; stir until shaggy dough forms.

488	Eggplant Parmesan Rolls with Swiss Chard and Fresh Mint	The Original:p Breaded, fried eggplant with a thick oregano-flavored tomato sauce. pOur Version:p Broiled slices of eggplant wrapped around a mint-and chard-flecked ricotta filling.	Cover bottom and sides of each of 2 large colanders with 1 layer of eggplant slices; sprinkle generously with coarse salt. Continue layering eggplant slices in each colander, sprinkling each layer with coarse salt, until all eggplant slices are used. Place each colander over large bowl; let stand at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Rinse eggplant slices to remove excess salt; dry thoroughly with paper towels.@newline@Position oven rack 5 to 6 inches from heat source and preheat broiler. Line 3 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Arrange eggplant slices in single layer on prepared baking sheets. Brush both sides of eggplant slices with olive oil.

504	Paella Valenciana	This is the classic country paella of Valencia, made with chicken and rabbit, and in snail season, cooked snails called pvaquetasp. Authentic paella should be made over firewood. Twigs from olive or orange trees are used for hot flames, and thicker logs are used for a slower fire. The trick is to have both at the same time, so that the meat and vegetables can be browned slowly, then the rice brought to the boil over the hottest part of the fire, then set over a lower flame. If you can't build a wood fire, a charcoal one will do. Valencian pbachoqueta de herradurap and Valencian pgarrofnp (special green and flat green beans, respectively, from the region) were called for in the original recipe, but other green beans can be substituted, and cooked dried beans or lima beans can be substituted for the flat green beans. You can also have your butcher cut up the rabbit for you, if desired.	1. Bring 10 cups of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add the dried beans. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until just tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir in 2 teaspoons of salt and let rest in their liquid for about 30 minutes before draining.@newline@2. Cut up the rabbit: Cut off the hind legs, using a sharp boning knife to slice between each leg and the hip joint. Cut each hind leg into two pieces, slicing at the joint between the thigh and leg. Cut off the front legs, slicing between each leg and the shoulder joint. Cut the body into three sections: ribs, loin, and bottom, using a heavy meat cleaver. Cut the loin in half, then cut the ribs in half through the breast and backbone, then cut each half in half.@newline@3. Prepare a wood (or charcoal) fire and heat the oil in a large paella pan set over the hottest part of the fire. Season the chicken and rabbit with 2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and rabbit and fry over medium-high heat, turning the meat to brown all sides evenly, 8 to 10 minutes.@newline@4. Add the tomatoes, onions, garlic, and green beans and continue to cook over medium heat until the beans are nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Add 10 cups of water and the rosemary sprig and move to the hottest part of the grill, or rearrange or add coals to raise the heat to high. Cover the pan with a grill lid.@newline@5. Remove the lid when the water comes to a boil. Stir in 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt and the saffron, then sprinkle the rice evenly around the pan directly into the liquid, avoiding the meat.@newline@6. Add the broad beans. Stir gently one time only to evenly distribute the rice (do not stir again). Remove the rosemary.@newline@7. Cook, uncovered, turning the pan one-quarter turn every 5 minutes to help ensure even heat distribution. Cook the rice over high heat for 10 minutes, or until the water is almost absorbed, then move to a cooler part of the grill and cook at a gentle simmer over low heat for another 10 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. The rice should be al dente when it is done; if it is too firm when the liquid is absorbed, add additional water 1 cup at a time, continuing cooking until the rice is done. During this period, keep the heat at a level that allows the liquid to simmer gently.@newline@8. Remove the paella from the heat, and cover and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve about 2 cups of the rice and vegetables and 1 piece each of the rabbit and chicken for each of 8 servings in large heated soup bowls. Or place the warm paella pan on the table and allow guests to serve themselves.	1

Season to taste with salt and pepper.@newline@5. Remove the meat from the ham hocks and cut it into medium dice. Remove the rind from the bacon and cut it into a medium dice. Add the diced ham and bacon to the beans and simmer 15 minutes. Slice the corned beef, beef, and separate the spareribs into portions. Add them to the beans and continue to simmer until the feijoada is very flavorful and thickened, about 15 minutes	9
506	Mediterranean Chef Salad with Polenta Croutons	Crispy cornmeal polenta is the health star of this salad: It may be easier for your body to absorb corn's carotenoids from milled products such as polenta, rather than from whole kernels.

512	Calas Fried Rice Fritters	This is a recipe lost to most New Orleanians, save for a few old bucks and grannys who can remember calas fried rice fritters being sold in the streets first thing in the morning in the French Quarter by women of African descent who carried them in baskets balanced on their heads, shouting out "Belle cala! Tout chaud!" Crisp around the edges with a plump, toothsome belly, these fritters beg to be served with obscene quantities of earthy, sorghum-like cane syrup, though traditionalists may opt for confectioners' sugar instead. A cup of strong coffee or a caf au lait is the ideal accompaniment.p	Bring 1 cup of water and a pinch of salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the rice, stir once, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pan, cooking 18 to 20 minutes or until the grains of rice are plump and fluff apart with a fork. Turn the rice out onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and cool for 15 minutes, then transfer to a plastic container (don't pack it in). Cover with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in the top. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 2 days.@newline@Pour enough peanut oil into a large pot to fill it to a 2 1/2- to 3-inch depth and bring to a temperature between 350F and 360F over medium heat. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside.@newline@While the oil heats up, place the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla on high speed until foamy and tripled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Sift in half of the dry ingredients, add the salt, and mix on low speed until only a few dry streaks remain. Sift in the remaining dry ingredients and mix on low speed for a few turns, then add the rice and mix until the fritter batter just comes together into a loose, roughly textured ball.@newline@Once your oil is hot, dip a teaspoon in the hot oil, then into the batter and scoop out a heaping teaspoonful. Hold the spoon close to the oil and let the batter roll off and into the oil. Repeat with the remaining batter; using a slotted spoon, turn and baste the fritters occasionally, allowing them to become golden brown on all sides. (Fry the fritters in two batches if your pot becomes overcrowded.) If the temperature of the oil dips below 350F, increase the heat to medium-high. Once the fritters are golden brown, transfer them to the prepared plate to cool slightly. Serve on a small plate drizzled with lots of cane syrup.	9
513	Green Onion Sausage and Shrimp Gravy	In South Louisiana, any sauce is called gravy. This dish would be our equivalent of biscuits and sausage gravy, except we've got all this seafood down here that finds its way into nearly everything. Serve this gravy over pbiscuitsp ) with pOeufs au Platp , and you've really got something. As a chef, I make this a bit more complicated than it needs to be: I start with the shrimp in the pan, then remove them so they don't overcook, and then I add them back once it's all come together.	1. Melt the bacon fat in a large heavy-bottomed pan over high heat, then add the pork sausage and cook, breaking up the meat with the back of a wooden spoon, until it is browned, 1215 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring often with the spoon, until the onions are deep brown, about another 15 minutes.@newline@2. Reduce the heat to moderate, then sprinkle the flour into the pan, stirring to mix it into the sausage and onions. Cook for about 2 minutes to remove the raw flavor from the flour.@newline@3. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper, then add them to the pan, stirring and tossing them with a spatula. Saut until they turn pink, about 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp from the pan and set aside while you continue making the sauce.@newline@4. Add the bell pepper, garlic, pepper flakes, allspice, Worcestershire, tomatoes, and Chicken Stock to the pan, stirring well. Increase heat and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. Add the thyme, green onions, and shrimp and cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.	4
514	Jalapeo Cheese Grits	These cheesy grits are the perfect base for pVeal Grilladesp or almost anything else.	1. Heat 4 cups of water in a large heavy-bottomed pot over high heat until it comes to a boil. Slowly pour in the grits while whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 20 minutes.@newline@2. While the grits are cooking, pan-roast the jalapeo pepper in a small skillet over high heat until the skin is brown and blistered. Cut the pepper in half lengthwise and remove the skin and the seeds from the pepper and discard. Mince the flesh and add it to the pot of grits.@newline@3. Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the butter, mascarpone, and Edam cheese. Season with salt.	9
515	Slow-Cooked Veal Grillades	Editor's note:p Serve this veal with Chef John Besh's pJalapeo Cheese Gritsp .p	1. Season the veal cutlets with salt and pepper. Whisk the flour together with the Creole Spices in a medium bowl. Dredge the cutlets in the seasoned flour and shake off excess. Reserve a tablespoon of seasoned flour.@newline@2. Melt the bacon fat in a large skillet over high heat. Fry the cutlets, several at a time, until golden brown on both sides. Take care not to overcrowd the skillet. Remove cutlets from skillet and continue to cook in batches until all the veal has been browned. Set the veal aside while you continue making the sauce.@newline@3. Reduce the heat to medium-high, add the onions to the same skillet, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until they are a deep mahogany color, about 20 minutes. Add the celery, bell pepper, and garlic, reduce the heat to moderate, and continue cooking, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the 1 tablespoon of reserved seasoned flour into the skillet and stir to mix it into the vegetables.@newline@4. Increase heat to high, stir in the tomatoes and Veal Stock, and cook until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderate and stir the thyme, pepper flakes, bay leaf, and Worcestershire into the vegetables. Add the veal cutlets, cover, and simmer until the veal is fork tender, about 45 minutes.@newline@5. Season with salt, pepper, and Tabasco, then add the green onions. Serve over creamy Jalapeo Cheese Grits .	9
516	Beignets	Like many delicious treats, this preparation takes a bit of time and planning. You can speed up the process of proofing the dough if you leave the dough covered at room temperature for an hour or so, instead of letting it rest in the refrigerator overnight.	1. Pour the warm milk into a large bowl. Mix 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar, the yeast, and a heaping tablespoon of the flour into the milk, mixing with a whisk, until both the sugar and the yeast have dissolved.@newline@2. Once bubbles have developed on the surface of the milk and it begins to foam, whisk in the butter, salt, and vanilla. Add the remaining flour and sugar, folding them into the wet ingredients with a large rubber spatula. Knead the dough by hand in the bowl for about 5 minutes, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for 68 hours.@newline@3. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch squares, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow the beignets to rise for about an hour.@newline@4. Heat the oil in a large deep skillet over high heat until it reaches 350F. Use a candy thermometer to check temperature. Fry the beignets in small batches in the hot oil, turning them every 30 seconds or so with tongs, until golden brown all over. Use tongs to remove beignets from the oil and drain on paper towels. Put the powdered sugar into a fine-mesh strainer and dust the warm beignets generously with the sugar.	2
517	Buttermilk Beignets	Up until I was about 12 years old, my parents took my sister, Tracy, and me to Easter service at St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square. The only way they could keep us in check during mass was by bribing us to be good and quiet with promises of post-church beignets at Caf de Monde across the street. We'd get so excited about the prospect of massive quantities of sugar that we probably would have done pretty much anything to ensure we got beignets before going home. Mom was a bit of a stickler when it came to sweets; I mean, at our house, Raisin Bran was considered toeing the line of junk food! So you can only imagine how amped up we were at the mere prospect of real, honest-to-goodness fried dough piled sky-high with a mountain of powdered sugar.p	Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until small bubbles form at the surface. Remove from the heat, add the buttermilk, and then pour into a stand mixer bowl. Whisk in the yeast and the sugar and set aside for 5 minutes. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix on low speed, using a dough hook, until the dry ingredients are moistened, 3 to 4 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium and continue mixing until the dough forms a loose ball and is still quite wet and tacky, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set the dough aside in a draft-free spot for 1 hour.@newline@Pour enough peanut oil into a large pot to fill it to a depth of 3 inches and bring to a temperature of 375F over medium heat (this will take about 20 minutes). Line a plate with paper towels and set aside.@newline@Lightly flour your work surface and turn the dough out on it. Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour, gently press to flatten, fold it in half, and gently tuck the ends under to create a rough-shaped round. Dust again and roll the dough out into a -inch- to / -inch-thick circle. Let the dough rest for 1 minute before using a chef's knife, a bench knife, or a pizza wheel to cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares (you should get about 48).@newline@Gently stretch a beignet lengthwise and carefully drop it into the oil. Add a few beignets (don't overcrowd them, otherwise the oil will cool down and the beignets will soak up oil and be greasy) and fry until puffed and golden brown, turning them often with a slotted spoon, for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the prepared plate to drain while you cook the rest. Serve while still warm, buried under a mound of confectioners' sugar, with hot coffee on the side.	7
518	Oeufs Au Plat	Editor's note:p Serve these fried eggs with Chef John Besh's pGreen Onion Sausage and Shrimp Gravyp .p	1. Rub a room-temperature 9-inch skillet with the butter. Place the skillet on the burner without turning it on. Crack the eggs into the skillet on opposite sides of the pan from each other.@newline@2. Turn the heat on to medium-low and cook the eggs until the whites have coagulated and turned opaque. Season the eggs with salt and serve with Green Onion Sausage and Shrimp Gravy , if you like.	2
519	Chocolate Cupped Cakes with Coffee and Chicory	I'd often sneak into my mom's car and ride stowaway-style in the back seat when she left home to "make groceries" at the A&P or Schwegmann's. No sooner had she turned off the ignition than I'd pop my head up and scare the bejesus out of her! In the market, we'd get coffee beans ground fresh from this giant red coffee grinderI swear it was at least 3 feet tall. My mom gave the coffee man (usually the bagger at the checkout aisle) explicit instructions on the coarseness of the bean grind for her chicory-laced coffee. After he had bagged our beans, I'd stick my nose up the metal spout and inhale the heady aroma that always made me dizzy and happy.p	Heat the oven to 350F. Spray the insides of 6 large oven-safe coffee cups or six 6-ounce ramekins with nonstick cooking spray and place on a rimmed baking sheet.@newline@To make the cocoa sprinkle, whisk 1/4 cup of the sugar, the light brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the cocoa powder in a small bowl until most of the brown sugar lumps are broken up, and set aside.@newline@Using a stand mixer (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer), blend the butter and remaining sugar together on medium speed until the sugar looks like wet sand, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the cream and vanilla, mixing until well blended, using a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary.@newline@Whisk the flour, the remaining cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl and then add it to the butter mixture. Mix on low speed until a stiff dough comes together, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 15 seconds.@newline@Divide the batter between the coffee cups, filling each one about half full, using the back of a spoon to press the batter into the cup. Top each with 2 tablespoons of the reserved cocoa sprinkle and then pour 21/2 tablespoons of coffee over the cocoa. Bake until the cakes souffl up and the top of each cake is crusty and dry on top with no visible wet spots, about 55 to 60 minutes. Cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.	1
520	Timmy's Brandy Milk Punch	My friend Timmy Reily makes the best version of this classic New Orleans drink. He likes to use the finest brandy, but once you've added all the other ingredients the brandy doesn't matter so much. You may need to add a bit more sugar, so taste a little and sweeten as you go.	1. Put the brandy, milk, sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and ice cubes into a blender and blend for 20 seconds.@newline@2. Strain into glasses of crushed ice and serve.	11
521	King Cake	As you knead the dough for this Mardi Gras cake, watch for it to begin to pull away from the sides of the mixing bowl. If that doesn't happen (because the moisture content in flour fluctuates with the humidity), add a spoonful or two more flour.	1. For the cake, pour the warm milk into a large bowl. Whisk in the granulated sugar, yeast, and a heaping tablespoon of the flour, mixing until both the sugar and the yeast have dissolved.@newline@2. Once bubbles have developed on the surface of the milk and it begins to foam, whisk in the butter, eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest. Add the remaining flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg and fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a large rubber spatula.@newline@3. After the dough comes together, pulling away from the sides of the bowl, shape it into a large ball. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it is smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes.@newline@4. Put the dough back into the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a draft-free place to let it proof, or rise, for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough has doubled in volume.@newline@5. Preheat the oven to 375F. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough between your palms into a long strip, making 3 ropes of equal length. Braid the 3 ropes around one another and then form the braided loaf into a circle, pinching ends together to seal. Gently lay the braided dough on a nonstick cookie sheet and let it rise until it doubles in size, about 30 minutes.@newline@6. Once it's doubled in size, place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake until the braid is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool for 30 minutes.@newline@7. For the icing, while the cake is cooling, whisk together the powdered sugar, condensed milk, and lemon juice in a bowl until the icing is smooth and very spreadable. If the icing is too thick, add a bit more condensed milk; if it's a touch too loose, add a little more powdered sugar.@newline@8. Once the cake has cooled, spread the icing over the top of the cake and sprinkle with purple, green, and gold decorative sugars while the icing is still wet. Tuck the fve or plastic baby into the underside of the cake and, using a spatula, slide the cake onto a platter.	1
522	Chowders	Traditional chowders all start off with a hearty soup base of onions and potatoes, and that makes a good soup just by itself. To this fragrant base you then add chunks of fish, or clams, or corn, or whatever else seems appropriate. (Note: You may leave out the pork and substitute another tablespoon of butter for sauting the onions.)	Saut the pork or bacon bits slowly with the butter in a large saucepan for 5 minutes, or until pieces begin to brown. Stir in the onions and bay leaf; cover, and cook slowly 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are tender. Drain off fat and blend crackers or bread crumbs into onions. Pour in the liquid; add the potatoes and simmer, loosely covered, for 20 minutes or so, until the potatoes are tender. Season to taste with salt and white pepper, and the soup base is ready.	1
523	Roasted Leg of Lamb with North African Spices, Lemon, and Onions	I call this herb and spice rub North African because, besides the classic oregano and rosemary, it contains Tunisian and Moroccan spices such as caraway, cumin, and turmeric. In addition, it is spiked with harissa, the ubiquitous hot pepper paste that is to Arab North Africa what chile oil is to Asia. Use the same spice mixture to rub poultry, beef, or pork two to three hours before grilling and leave at room temperature. Or you can mix 3 tablespoons of this rub with 3 tablespoons yogurt and baste chicken breasts or legs or skewered lamb and pork before grilling. Better yet, leave in the spicy yogurt marinade in the refrigerator overnight.	In a spice grinder, a clean coffee grinder, or a mortar, grind the salt, oregano, rosemary, caraway, cumin, and turmeric to a fine powder. Transfer to a bowl and add the harissa and chopped garlic. Add the olive oil to make a thick paste. Make 8 or 9 deep slits all over the lamb and insert some of the spice paste, rubbing the paste all over the surface of the meat. Cover and let stand for 1 hour at room temperature or, preferably, refrigerate for at least 5 hours or overnight. Bring to room temperature before roasting.@newline@Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the leg of lamb fat side down in a roasting pan that will hold the onions in one layer. Roast for 20 minutes. Mix the lemon juice and wine in a small bowl. Turn the meat and pour the lemon-wine mixture over it. (If you are roasting the lamb in a clay dish, warm the mixture first, because cold liquid can cause the clay to crack.) Reduce the oven temperature to 375F and roast for 35 minutes, basting every 10 to 15 minutes with the pan juices. If the pan dries out, add a little more wine.@newline@Transfer the lamb to a plate and add the onions to the pan, tossing them well to coat them with the pan juices. Add the rosemary sprigs or sprinkle with dried rosemary, toss, place the lamb on the onions, and continue roasting, basting often, for another 30 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 135F. Transfer the meat to a heated platter, cover with a double layer of aluminum foil, and set aside. (Leave the oven on.) If the pan juices are watery, transfer most of them to a saucepan and cook briefly to reduce.@newline@Meanwhile, return the pan to the oven and continue baking the onions until tender, with browned edges. Turn the oven to broil. Place the lamb on the onions again and broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the surface is deep brown and crackling. Carve the lamb and serve, passing the pan juices in a bowl or sauceboat at the table.	1
524	Limoncello Tiramis	One of the delights of making tiramis is its versatility. This recipe makes a family-style dessert in a large dish, but you can easily compose single servings in dessert glasses, wine goblets, or even elegant teacups for a more impressive presentation, in the style of Signora Garatti's original "coppa imperiale." And while the conventional version of tiramis calls for espresso soaked savoiardi, I've found that other flavors can be incorporated into the dessert with great success. Here, the brightness of fresh lemons and limoncello liqueur lace the cream and soaking syrup to make for a tiramis that is refreshing and irresistible.	Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs, putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.@newline@Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.@newline@To make the base for the tiramis, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and  cup of the limoncello until well blended.@newline@Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.@newline@Meanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan.@newline@Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.@newline@In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks. When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.@newline@Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie brieflyif it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.@newline@Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream. Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramis airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramis in any size you like, and lift each out of the pan onto dessert plates.	4
525	Asparagus Velout	NoDescription	1. Wash the asparagus. Cut 2 inches (5 cm.) off the tips and save them for another use. Do not peel the stalks but cut them into 15-inch (3-cm.) pieces.@newline@2. Bring the stock or broth to a boil in a soup pot. When it bubbles, add the asparagus pieces and sugar. Turn down the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.@newline@3. Blend and pass through a fine strainer (a chinois if possible), pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Put the soup back in the pot, bring back to a boil, and boil about 30 minutes more.@newline@4. Thoroughly mix the cornstarch in a bowl with 1 tablespoon cold water. Beat the yolk and cream together in a bowl large enough to hold all the soup.@newline@5. When the soup in the pot has been reduced by about half, whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Boil for 1 minute, whisking constantly, and then gently pour everything into the bowl with the egg-cream mixture, whisking as you pour.@newline@6. Pour the contents of the bowl back into the soup pot and heat very gently in order to thicken. Stir with a spatula and turn off the heat at the first sign of boiling. Blend. Season with salt as necessary.	12
526	Rhubarb Fool	The fool originated in England in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It is a simple dessert that combines tart fruit with whipped cream. The British traditionally made this dessert with gooseberries, but in spring rhubarb is the perfect choice, with its bright, tart flavor. A very simple dessert to prepare (we wince to say any fool can make it), this recipe calls for cooking a compote and then folding in whipped cream. It is elegant served with a shortbread cookie, which adds a delicious crispy element. To really doll it up, add a Candied Rhubarb Strip.	To make the fool, put the rhubarb, honey, orange zest and juice, candied ginger, vanilla bean, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to combine, then cover and cook, stirring every few minutes, for 10 minutes, until the mixture has come to a boil and the rhubarb has softened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then remove the vanilla bean. Transfer the compote to a bowl, and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, until very cold.@newline@Whip the cream and sugar until soft peaks form, either by hand or using an electric mixer on medium speed. Set aside 1/3 cup of the compote to garnish the dessert, then fold the remaining compote into the whipped cream. Spoon the fool into six 1/2-cup glasses or dishes and chill for 1 hour before serving topped with the remaining compote.@newline@Storage: This fool is best served the day it is made, but any leftovers can be covered with plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.	8
527	Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake	Chocolate and pears make an excellent combination. Here, bittersweet chocolate and sweet pears meld together to form the perfect balance. For this recipe, you can either take a rustic approach and toss the pears haphazardly into the pan or opt for a more elegant look by arranging the pears in concentric circles. Look for a good dark chocolate, which is not the same as unsweetened chocolate. Also, there are two kinds of unsweetened cocoa on the market; be sure to use unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa, not natural cocoa. When combined with baking soda, natural cocoa can impart a bitter taste to baked goods and cause them to rise too much.	Butter a 9-inch round baking pan.@newline@To make the fruit topping, put the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan (one with a tight-fitting lid) and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then cover and cook for 2 minutes. (Covering in this way allows the steam to wash down the sides of pan, which will prevent any sugar crystals from forming.) Uncover the saucepan and continue to boil the sugar, gently and slowly swirling the pan as needed to cook the caramel evenly, until it becomes a dark amber color. Occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Carefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan and allow it to harden. The pan will be very hot from the sugar, so take care in moving it if you need to. Fan the pear slices on top of the caramel in a circle around the perimeter, filling in the center with the remaining slices.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F.	11
528	Confetti Corn BreadCrusted Shrimp in Creole Filling	I love the taste of buttery corn bread and the texture of the filling and the topping. This is a great dish to eat with soup spoons. For an attractive presentation, spoon generous portions into pretty rimmed soup bowls, or bake in individual casserole dishes or crocks. To save time, make the Creole Filling a day ahead (see Note).	To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saut pan or skillet over high heat. Add the onion, celery, and green bell peppers. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and Creole seasoning, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir constantly, about 2 minutes, until slightly thickened. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaf. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and heat through, about 2 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and pour the filling into an 8-by-8-inch square or round baking dish. Set aside in a warm area, while preparing the topping.@newline@To prepare the topping, preheat the oven to 375F. Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Incorporate the eggs one at a time and mix until smooth. Add the green chiles, creamed corn, red and green bell peppers, the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the mixture forms a soft batter.@newline@Carefully dollop the corn bread batter over the filling. Using an offset metal spatula, spread the batter smoothly across the top of the casserole, forming a thin layer. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet in the center of the oven. Bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven to a cooling rack. Cut through the corn bread with a small knife. Scoop 6 to 8 generous portions of the filling and the corn bread into large soup bowls or onto plates.	2
529	Deep-Dish Winter Fruit Pie With Walnut Crumb	This deep-dish crumb-topped pie combines several winter fruits and confirms that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The pears become soft, the apples remain slightly firm, the figs add texture and sweetness, and the tart cranberries pop in your mouth, making this rustic pie a sensory treat. Be sure to plan ahead, as this recipe calls for chilling the dough for one hour, chilling it again after you roll it out (this reduces shrinkage of the crust during baking), and then baking the pie for over an hour. It is an hours-long process, off and on, but it is worth every minute. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a glass of apple or pear brandy (preferably from Clear Creek Distillery), it is the perfect final touch to a dinner party.	To make the pie pastry, put the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl, stir to combine, then put the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes.@newline@Add the butter to the flour mixture and toss to evenly coat. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender, a food processor, an electric mixer, or your hands, just until the mixture becomes coarse and crumbly and the butter is the size of peas. Stir the water and lemon juice together, then pour over the dry ingredients and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened.@newline@Dump the dough onto a well-floured work surface and press it into a 6-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.@newline@Roll the chilled dough into a 14-inch disk, then line a 9 or 10 by 3-inch springform pan with the rolled-out dough. Patch any holes and trim off any dough that hangs over the edges of the pan. Chill for an additional 30 minutes while you prepare the crumb topping and the fruit filling.	11
530	Thyme, Lemon, and Sea-Salt Shortbread	Tender and crisp, packed with delicate herbal and aromatic lemon flavors, these rolled shortbread cookies accented with a little sea salt are easy to prepare, versatile, and delicious.	Stir the flour, salt, lemon peel, and thyme together in a medium bowl. With your fingertips, rub the butter into the dry ingredients until a coarse, crumbly mixture forms. Blend the lightly beaten egg, egg yolks, and water together. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the egg mixture for brushing.@newline@Make a well in the center of the flour. Add the remaining egg mixture and blend together with your hands without kneading the dough together; the dough will look a bit crumbly. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough together once or twice, just until it sticks together. Press the dough into a 1-inch disc, wrap in plastic film, and refrigerate until firm, about 1/2 hour.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F and line the bottom of a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap, and place it on a floured work surface. Press the dough into a 6-by-5-inch rectangle. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a larger 10-by-7-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough in half, forming two 5-by-7-inch pieces. Using a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife, cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Carefully place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet leaving a little room between each cookie. Brush the tops with the reserved egg mixture and sprinkle a little coarse sea salt on top. Gently press the salt into the surface of each cookie so it does not fall off. Bake until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and serve warm or at room temperature. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.	6
531	Turkish Doughnuts with Rose Hip Syrup	Turkey is a paradise for street-food fans, and when Feniger travels there, she especially loves nibbling on the airy doughnuts soaked in syrup that are offered by many vendors. She made them her own by lacing a basic cream-puff dough with cardamom and cinnamon. Dried rose hips steeped in the syrup add a little texture and tartness to the sticky, fragrant bites.	Make rose hip syrup: Bring water, sugar, rose hips, and cardamom pods to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then gently simmer, uncovered, until rose hips are softened, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in rose water and lemon juice.	11
532	Cantaloupe Aqua Fresca with Beet Swirl	Sold at Mexican street stands in large, clear barrelsthe better to show off their festive colorspagua frescasp, or "fresh waters," can be made with all kinds of fruits and herbs, the riper the better. Here, Feniger tops a traditional cantaloupe cooler with a decorative swirl of vivid beet pure. Roasting the beet heightens its sweetness and intensifies its color.	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Wrap beet in foil and put in a small 4-sided sheet pan, then roast until tender when pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes. Unwrap and let stand until cool enough to handle.@newline@While beet roasts, pure cantaloupe, 3 cups water, lime juice, and 1/4 to 1/3 cup sugar (to taste) in 3 to 4 batches in a blender until very smooth, about 1 minute per batch. Chill agua fresca until cold, about 2 hours.@newline@Peel and chop beet, then pure with remaining cup water and remaining tablespoon sugar in cleaned blender until smooth. Chill beet pure until cold, about 2 hours.@newline@To serve, pour agua fresca over ice in tall glasses, then dollop 1 Tbsp beet pure on top of each drink, swirling it decoratively with a spoon.	3
533	Black Barbecue Pork Chops with Thumbelina Carrots	Based on depth rather than tanginess or sweetness, Lee's signature black barbecue sauce is a cultural interaction that includes the thin, Worcestershire saucelike "dip" for mutton ribs found in and around Owensboro, Kentucky; red-eye gravy; an earthy pmolep; and brothy, robust pkalbip, the braised short ribs of Korea. The melting pot, as they say, simmers on.	Make barbecue sauce: Heat butter and olive oil in a 4-to 5-quart pot over medium-low heat until foam subsides. Cook onion, chopped garlic, jalapeo, and raisins, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, 7 to 9 minutes.@newline@Add bourbon (use caution; alcohol may ignite) and boil, scraping up any brown bits, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in coffee, then boil until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with cola.@newline@Add ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, black bean paste, and chocolate and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.@newline@Add spices and 1 teaspoon pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 10 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and cool 15 minutes. Pure sauce in a blender with remaining 2 garlic cloves, lime juice, and sesame oil until smooth and thick.	10
534	Lamb Shank Rag with Anson Mills Grits	Lee believes that classic dishes are far from being precious artifacts; they are inherently adaptable, and that's what makes them timeless. The starting point here was his "very Italian" wine importer, Enrico Battisti, but instead of polenta, Lee uses quick-cooking stone-ground grits from Anson Mills, in Columbia, South Carolina."They're better than any polenta," he says, "because they're so fresh. I call them hero grits."	Make rag: Pat lamb shanks dry and season with kosher salt (rounded 1/2 teaspoon) and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Brown shanks on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes, then transfer to paper towels to drain. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to pot, then cook onion, garlic, plum tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, and fennel with thyme, red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.@newline@Return lamb shanks to pot with stock, bourbon, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and honey and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.@newline@Remove meat from bones, discarding bones, and skim fat from cooking liquid, then return meat to pot. Simmer rag , uncovered, stirring frequently, 15 minutes.@newline@Just before serving, stir in radicchio and scallion.	6
535	Country Ham and Cheddar Pretzel Bites with Jalapeo Mustard	Simultaneously salty, sharp, spicy, and sweet (in other words, completely irresistible), these nuggets are chef Edward Lee's way of saying, "You can have a casual meal without compromising true culinary endeavor." The tradition of serving mustard with a soft pretzel is strictly an American one; Lee makes his own honey mustard, jazzing it up with chiles. For sources for country ham and pretzel salt.	Stir together yeast, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and warm water in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, 5 to 8 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.) In a separate bowl, stir remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar into warm milk until dissolved.@newline@Add 2 1/2 cups flour and milk mixture to yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until a soft dough forms, adding up to 1/2 cup additional flour, a little at a time, if necessary. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled and bubbles appear on surface, about 2 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 400F with rack in upper and lower thirds. Line two 4-sided sheet pans with parchment paper.@newline@Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 4 equal pieces. Lightly dust your hands with flour, then gently roll and stretch 1 piece of dough to form a 12-inch-long rope. Flatten dough and arrange so a long side is nearest you, then roll out to a roughly 12- by 4-inch rectangle with a lightly floured rolling pin. Gently press one fourth of ham and cheese into lower third of rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch border along bottom edge. Stretch bottom edge of dough up over filling and press tightly to seal, then roll up as tightly as possible to form a rope. Cut rope into 12 pieces and transfer to a sheet pan. Make 3 more ropes with remaining dough, ham, and cheese and cut into pieces, transferring to sheet pans. Let rest at room temperature, uncovered, 30 minutes (dough will rise slightly).@newline@Bring water (6 cups) to a boil in a 4-to 5-quart saucepan. Reduce heat and stir in baking soda. Cook pretzel bites in batches in gently simmering water, turning once, until slightly puffed, about 20 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to sheet pans.@newline@Bake until puffed and golden-brown, about 15 minutes (cheese may ooze slightly).@newline@Meanwhile, stir together mustard, jalapeos, and honey.@newline@Brush warm pretzel bites with butter and sprinkle with pretzel salt. Serve warm or at room temperature with jalapeo mustard for dipping.	12
536	Salted Mint Lassi	Yogurt drinks are popular throughout Indiasome are flavored with sugar or fruit, while others, like this one, are more savory. "I give sample tastes of this all the time at the restaurant," says Susan Feniger, "and people are shocked by how refreshing it is."	Toast cumin in a dry small heavy skillet over medium heat, shaking skillet frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer 1 1/2 teaspoons to a blender with mint, yogurt, kosher salt, and water.@newline@Blend until pale green with flecks of mint and cumin. Serve lassi over ice and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds.	5
537	Beet and Pear Napoleons with Ginger Juice Vinaigrette	What you find here and on page 96aside from a striking striped presentationis an equally beautiful expression of flavors. Because both beets and pears are at the height of their season, Lee has no desire, as he says, "to mess with them too much." He adds, "Nature trumps the ability of any chef." The ginger juice in the vinaigrette is inspired by Lee's Asian roots.	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Wrap beets in foil and roast until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand until cool enough to handle, then slice crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Cool completely.@newline@Meanwhile, finely grate ginger with a Microplane over a kitchen-towel-lined bowl. Carefully gather towel around ginger and squeeze until you have 2 tablespoons ginger juice. Whisk in orange juice, sugar, and oil. Season with salt and pepper. Divide vinaigrette evenly between 2 small bowls.@newline@Cut pears lengthwise around core into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut out 18 rounds from slices using cookie cutter and put in one bowl of vinaigrette.@newline@Cut out 18 rounds from beet slices and put in other bowl. Toss pears and beets with vinaigrette to coat well.@newline@To assemble napoleons, put 1 beet round on each of 6 plates (see cooks' note, below) and top with a tarragon leaf. Top with 1 pear round, then another tarragon leaf. Repeat layering 2 more times. Discard vinaigrette used for beets.@newline@Toss greens with some of remaining vinaigrette and place around each napoleon. Finely grate apple (including skin) into a bowl. Spoon a heaping teaspoon apple on top of each napoleon, then sprinkle with sea salt and poppy seeds. Drizzle with more vinaigrette if desired.	5
538	Barbecue-Rubbed Scallops with Creamy Sauerkraut Soup	Being the northernmost city in the South, Louisville has a complex blend of relatively unsung ethnicities, one of them being old-world German. The convergence of sauerkraut soupwhat families in neighborhoods like Schnitzelburg call home foodand barbecue-rubbed scallops is both quirky and logical in a very Louisville kind of way. The flavor combination is extraordinarily deliciousone taste and you'll understand what Edward Lee is all about. For sources for sumac.	Make soup: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 5-quart pot over medium heat, then cook bacon and onion, stirring occasionally, until most of bacon fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and wine and simmer briskly, uncovered, until most of wine has evaporated, about 3 minutes.@newline@Stir in stock and heavy cream, then simmer gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and stir in mustard, sour cream, and remaining 2 tablespoon butter. Pure soup in batches in a blender until smooth and creamy (use caution when blending hot liquids), then return to pot. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.	11
539	Slow-Cooked Tomato and Herb White Beans	These soupy beans resonate with the deep notes of tomato, garlic, and thyme. Meant to be served with the pcountry hashp , they would also go well with pork chops or grilled sausages.	Soak beans: Soak beans overnight (8 to 12 hours) in water to cover by 2 inches or quick-soak (see cooks' note, below), then drain.	9
540	Tapioca Pilaf	Feniger first encountered this fragrant pilaf while visiting her friend Alan Wagner, who cooks at an ashram in India. The pilaf has since become a popular addition to Street's menu. The first thing you'll notice is the tapioca pearls gratifyingly chewy, almost slippery texture. Then you'll take in the pop of the mustard seeds, the denseness of the taro, the fresh coolness of the cilantro, and the savor of the peanuts and cumin. The most elusive flavor is that of the dried neem leaves. Theyre an optional ingredientyou can leave them out and the pilaf will still be deliciousbut they have an interesting astringency.	Bring water (10 cups) to a boil in a 3-to 4-quart pot. Add tapioca pearls and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until pearls are translucent around edge, have a white center, and are al dente, about 45 minutes more.@newline@While tapioca stands, cover taro with cold water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then simmer until almost tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer taro to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch dice.@newline@Drain tapioca in a sieve and rinse well under cold water. Let stand in sieve submerged in a bowl of cold water until ready to use.@newline@Heat butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then saut taro until just tender and golden, about 5 minutes. Add chile and garlic and saut until softened, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and neem leaves (if using) and saut until fragrant, about 30 seconds more.@newline@Lift sieve with tapioca out of water and shake to drain well. Add to taro mixture in skillet along with peanuts and 1/2 teaspoon salt and saut 2 minutes. Toss with cilantro and serve immediately.	6
541	Tamarind Ginger Cooler	Both ginger plants and tamarind trees grow in tropical spots around the world, including India, Asia, and Latin America, where the two seasonings are regularly used in marinades, sauces, and drinks. So it was only natural for Feniger to take some of the spicy ginger syrup she had developed for the pCanton Ginger Kickp and mix it with tart tamarind. The result is very fresh and very quaffable. Feniger says that when they make it at Street, they often save the tamarind pulp that's left in the sieve and add more water; that tamarind liquid will be thinner than the first batch, but it will still have enough of its signature fruity sharpness for another round.	Break up tamarind with your fingers into a small heavy saucepan. Add 2 cups water and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up tamarind as it softens, 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes. Strain through sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids.@newline@Whisk together ginger syrup, tamarind pure, remaining 5 cups water, and kosher salt in a large pitcher. Chill until cold.@newline@Stir drink (it will separate as it stands), then pour into glasses filled two-thirds with ice. Top off with soda water.	1
542	Braised Bacon Carolina Rice	It's pretty hard to upstage bacon, but if you get your hands on some heirloom Carolina Gold rice, the granddaddy of long-grain rices in the United States, that's what you might end up doing. Lee cooks it uncovered, which allows the water to evaporate and thus concentrates the richness of the chicken stock and tomato juice.	Cook bacon in a 4-quart heavy pot over low heat until some of fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in spices.@newline@Add stock and tomato juice and bring to a boil. Stir in rice and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes (rice will be moist rather than fluffy and dry). Stir in celery leaves, butter, kosher salt, and pepper to taste, then remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.	12
543	Chess Pie with Blackened Pineapple Salsa and Caramel Sauce	The glory of a chess pie is its rich custard filling (long ago also used to fill tartlets called cheesecakes, hence the name). The secret to the accompanying salsa is to panfry the pineapple until it's charred, bringing out the fruit's acidic, musky qualities. And as for the last-minute drizzle of caramel saucehow bad could that be?	Make dough: Stir together flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl (or pulse in a food processor). Add butter and shortening and blend with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle 4 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.@newline@Squeeze a small handful: If dough doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated. (Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.)@newline@Turn out dough onto a work surface and form into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 1/2 hours.	1
544	Canton Ginger Kick	Kick is the right word to describe this golden cocktail, which underscores the shot of ginger liqueur with ginger syrup and lemon.	Stir together ginger syrup, vodka, ginger liqueur, and lemon juice in a pitcher.@newline@Divide among 6 (10-ounces) Old Fashioned glasses filled with ice. Top off with soda water. Spear a few slices candied ginger onto each of 6 wooden picks and add to drinks, then garnish with lemon wedges.	2
545	Harvest Topiary	Mix sheaves of dried wheat and rye tied with French ribbon to create a pair of topiaries for your sideboard or holiday table.	Cut 2 pieces of florist foam into 2 1/2-by-3-inch cubes. Place 1 inside each terra-cotta pot. Mix the dried wheat and rye and divide into 2 bunches 3 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap and secure each one with wire about halfway down the sheath, and again about 1 inch from the bottom. Hold a bunch securely and press firmly into the florist foam, making sure it is straight vertically. Fill the pot with mixed nuts, mounding them at the center. Cut the ribbon in half, making two 18-inch long pieces. Wrap each ribbon around a bunch several times, covering the wire, and tie with a bow.	7
546	Napkin Rings and a Decorated Vase from Corrugated Cardboard	Don't recycle corrugated cardboardreuse it! Cut, and tied with raffia, it makes fun, texturally interesting napkin rings and adds a creative touch to a plain vase. Add autumn-hued fresh or dried flowers to complete the project.	To make a napkin ring for each guest Cut a strip of corrugated cardboard measuring 2 inches across the ridges and 10 inches down. This will create a natural roll. If available, use an empty paper towel roll as a form for making the rings. Roll the length of corrugated cardboard to form a ring, securing it inconspicuously in a couple of places with tape. Wrap 2 or 3 strands of raffia around the middle of the napkin ring several times, and then double knot it. Cut the ends so they are 1 inch long. If using dried flowers, cut the stems so they are 1 inches long and slide them through the raffia to secure them. If using fresh flowers, wait until 1 hour before guests arrive to trim the stems and attach them to the napkin rings.	7
547	Tri-Tip Steak Frites with Red Wine Sauce	An inexpensive, well-marbled tri-tip roast (a cut from the bottom sirloin) easily yields individual steaks. A star of California's Santa Maria Valley barbecue scene for decades, it is sure to become one of your favorites as well. Tarragon isn't absolutely necessary, but it does give the fries a certain flair.	Preheat oven to 475F with racks in upper and lower thirds, with a 4-sided sheet pan in lower third.@newline@Toss fries with 2 tablespoons oil in hot sheet pan, then bake according to package instructions until golden and crisp.@newline@Meanwhile, pat steaks dry, then rub with peppercorns and 1/2 teaspoon salt.@newline@Heat remaining tablespoon oil in an ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sear steaks on all sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer skillet to upper third of oven and roast 9 to 10 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a plate and let rest 5 minutes.@newline@Add wine to skillet and boil, scraping up brown bits, until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add water and meat juices from plate and boil briskly until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in butter until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.@newline@Sprinkle fries with tarragon. Serve steaks with sauce and fries.	3
548	Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Fried Sage and Shaved Chestnuts	Frying sage leaves is easy and provides a real wow factor. The sage and chestnuts make an ideal foil for these pillowy gnocchi.	Make gnocchi: Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Pierce russet and sweet potatoes in several places with a fork, then bake in a 4-sided sheet pan until just tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.@newline@Cool potatoes slightly, then peel and force through ricer into sheet pan, spreading in an even layer. Cool potatoes completely.@newline@Lightly flour 2 or 3 large baking sheets or line with parchment paper.@newline@Beat together egg, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl.@newline@Gather potatoes into a mound in sheet pan, using a pastry scraper if you have one, and form a well in center.@newline@Pour egg mixture into well, then knead into potatoes. Knead in cheese and 1 1/2 cups flour, then knead, adding more flour as necessary, until mixture forms a smooth but slightly sticky dough. Dust top lightly with some of flour.@newline@Cut dough into 6 pieces. Form 1 piece of dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rope on a lightly floured surface. Cut rope into 1/2-inch pieces. Gently roll each piece into a ball and lightly dust with flour.@newline@Repeat with remaining 5 pieces of dough.@newline@Turn a fork over and hold at a 45-degree angle, with tips of tines touching work surface. Working with 1 at a time, roll gnocchi down fork tines, pressing with your thumb, to make ridges on 1 side. Transfer gnocchi as formed to baking sheets.	7
549	Red Wine Caramel Apples	NoDescription	Insert a wooden stick halfway into each apple at stem end. Line a tray with wax paper and lightly grease paper.@newline@Boil wine in a small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.@newline@Bring sugar and water to a boil in a 2 1/2-to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally so caramel colors evenly, until dark amber. Add reduced wine (mixture will bubble up and steam) and swirl pan. Add cream and simmer, stirring, until incorporated, then continue to simmer until thermometer registers 238F. Remove from heat and cool to 200F.@newline@Holding apples by the sticks, dip them in caramel and swirl to coat, letting excess drip off, then hold apples up (stick end down) for about 15 seconds to allow more caramel to set on apples. Put caramel apples, stick side up, on greased wax paper and let stand until caramel firms up, about 30 minutes.	9

551	Classic Mashed Potatoes	There is no such thing as too many starchy dishes on the holiday buffet table, right? For many families, Thanksgiving dinner wouldn't be right without mashed potatoes. It seems there is always one family member relegated to the task of whipping them at the last minutean honorable duty. And there is always someone else leaning over his shoulder making sure he adds a bit more butter. If you want to assign mashed potato duty to a family member, but would like to avoid the last minute chaos in the kitchen, know that it works perfectly well to cook and mash potatoes up to 1 hour in advance. They can be kept warm in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, or reheated in a microwave oven just before serving. If you use the do-ahead plan, be sure to add an extra pat of butter, or two!	Peel the potatoes and rinse under cold water. Cut each into quarters and place in a 3-to 4-quart saucepan. Cover with cold water, partially cover the pot, and bring the water to a boil. Uncover, add the 1 teaspoon of salt, and reduce the heat so the water boils gently. Cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the milk and butter together until the butter has melted and the mixture is hot but not boiling.@newline@Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pan over low heat for 1 minute to evaporate any excess water. Use a potato masher, ricer, or food mill to mash the potatoes. Stir the milk and butter mixture into the potatoes, a little at a time, until the potatoes are as soft and moist as you like. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, or keep warm in the top of a double boiler, or cover and rewarm in a microwave oven.	12
552	Italian Vegetable Stew (Ciambotta)	As a child, food editor Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez regularly enjoyed the hearty stew that her grandmother Mary Pacella prepared as a way to use up surplus produce from the garden. Today, however, Miraglia Eriquez makes it as often as she can during the summer and early fall, using garden produce at its peak.	Heat oil in a 7-to 8-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add onions, celery, carrots, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Add eggplant and water and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until eggplant is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.@newline@Stir in tomatoes with juice and bell peppers, then reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, cook green beans in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan of well-salted boiling water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Add zucchini to boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer with slotted spoon to bowl with green beans. Add potatoes to boiling water and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and add to beans and zucchini.@newline@Add boiled vegetables to stew and simmer, stirring, until all vegetables are very soft, about 15 minutes. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.	12
553	Rich Chocolate Mousse	Although trends come and go, chocolate mousse never fails to impress. Not only does it manage to convey both indulgence and comfort, it couldn't be simpler to make. This version is a true classic mousse in that the eggs are not cooked. You'll find it unbelievably smooth and voluptuous.	Melt chocolate and butter in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, gently stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat.@newline@Meanwhile, beat yolks in a small bowl with an electric mixer until thick enough to form a ribbon that takes a few seconds to dissolve, 2 to 4 minutes. Whisk yolks into chocolate mixture along with Cognac, then cool to warm.@newline@Beat cream in a medium bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks.@newline@Beat whites with salt in another bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks.@newline@Fold whipped cream and beaten whites into chocolate mixture gently but thoroughly. Transfer to stemmed glasses, 4-ounces ramekins, or a serving dish.	9
554	Spiced Pumpkin Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting	When it comes to dessert, I am a chocoholic first and fruit-pie lover second; but after several test batches to perfect this cake, I am completely won over, and so is everyone who has tasted it. This is simply a spectacular cakemoist and light with spiced pumpkin flavor and sweet bites of coconut and pineapple. In addition, it is a snap to make. It requires two 9-inch cake pans to make the layers, but the cake itself can be mixed together with a rubber spatula and bowl. If all the cake ingredients are pre-measured and the cake pans prepared, this can be a fun kitchen project to do with children, especially since it can be made ahead and frozen.	Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350F. Butter two 9-inch diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch sides. Line the bottom of each pan with a circle of parchment paper. Butter the parchment paper. Sprinkle the pans with flour, tap the pans to evenly distribute the flour, and then shake off the excess flour. Set aside.@newline@To make the cake, in a large bowl, sift together the 2 cups flour, the granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, oil, and vanilla. In another medium bowl, combine the pumpkin pure, coconut, crushed pineapple, and currants.@newline@Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Add the pumpkin mixture and stir just until combined. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, spreading it evenly. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Transfer to wire racks and let cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes. Invert the cakes onto the racks and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely before frosting the cakes.@newline@To make the frosting, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed for about 3 minutes until smooth. Add the butter and beat for about 2 minutes until combined. Add the pumpkin pure and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla and beat for about 3 minutes until fluffy.@newline@Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or platter. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the frosting over the top of the first cake layer. Spread the frosting right to the edge of the top without frosting the sides of the cake. Carefully place the second cake on top, lining up the edges. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake without frosting the sides. Swirl the frosting to decorate the top. Refrigerate the cake to set the frosting. Remove from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before serving.	11
555	Portobello Buffalo Burgers with Celery Apple Slaw	More and more people are cooking with ground buffalo meat because it's lower in fat than beef chuck. That very asset can turn into a liability if the meat is cooked too long, so here, sauted chopped portobello mushrooms contribute additional moistness and flavor. Don't reach for the ketchup: A crisp slaw of celery and apples in a mustardy dressing is a piquant surprise.	Cook vegetables for burgers: Pulse onion and mushrooms in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add mushroom mixture, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and rounded 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to brown and liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to warm, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.	6
556	Oven-Fried Panko Chicken	For those with a fear of frying, this oven method produces moist, flavorful meat and all of the requisite crunchthanks to the crisp panko bread crumbswith none of the usual mess. It's a terrific choice for an easy family dinner or casual entertaining.	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Stir together panko, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a pie plate.@newline@Stir together butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl, then brush all over chicken. Add chicken, 2 pieces at a time, to crumb mixture and coat evenly on both sides, pressing chicken into crumbs to help them adhere, then transfer, skin side up, to a shallow baking pan.@newline@Bake chicken until well browned and cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand, uncovered, 5 to 10 minutes to crisp.	5
557	Juniper-Brined Roast Turkey with Chanterelle Mushroom Gravy	Living in the Pacific Northwest, with our bounty of berries, tree-ripened fruits, hazelnuts, and wild mushrooms, makes going to the farmers' market feel like a season-long treasure hunt. I'm especially rewarded when I stop at the mushroom forager's stand and see a basket chock-full of chanterelle mushrooms. At the peak of the season, I buy fresh chanterelles and use them as often as I can, as in this golden-hued mushroom gravy accompaniment to the holiday bird.	Combine the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, sage, thyme, and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Mix well and set aside.@newline@Position a rack on the second-lowest level in the oven and preheat to 500F. Have ready a large roasting pan with a roasting rack, preferably V-shaped, set in the pan.@newline@Put 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture inside the neck cavity and 1/2 cup inside the chest cavity of the turkey. Scatter the remainder on the bottom of the roasting pan and add 1 cup water to the pan. Truss the turkey. Using a pastry brush, brush the turkey with half of the melted butter. Place the turkey, breast side down, on the roasting rack. Roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Baste the turkey with the pan juices and roast for 30 minutes longer.@newline@Remove the turkey from the oven. Using silicone oven mitts, regular oven mitts covered with aluminum foil, or wads of paper towels, turn the turkey breast side up. (It won't be very hot at this point.) Baste with the pan juices and the remaining melted butter, and return the turkey to the oven. Continue to roast, basting with the pan juices again after 45 minutes. At this point, check the internal temperature of the turkey by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of a thigh without touching bone. (As a point of reference, when the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 125F, the turkey is about 1 hour away from being done. Of course, roasting times will vary, depending on the size of the bird, its temperature when it went into the oven, whether or not it is stuffed, and your particular oven and the accuracy of the thermostat.) The turkey is done when the instant-read thermometer registers 160 to 165F when inserted into the thickest part of a thigh away from the bone.@newline@When the turkey is done, tilt the body so the juices from the main cavity run into the pan. Transfer to a carving board or serving platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the turkey rest for 30 to 40 minutes before carving, to allow the juices to redistribute. (The internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees while the turkey rests.)@newline@Strain the juices, vegetables, and browned bits from the roasting pan through a fine-mesh sieve set over a large glass measuring cup. Set aside and allow the fat to rise to the top. Spoon off the fat. The pan juices from a brined turkey are usually too salty to add to gravy, so I refrigerate it and add it to the water for making stock from the carcass; the juices provide additional flavor and the salt is diluted by the water.@newline@Carve the turkey. Serve, accompanied by the Chanterelle Mushroom Gravy.	10

564	German-Style Fried Potatoes	Boiling the potatoes and chilling them overnight makes them easy to cut and saut. Leftover potatoes and brisket would make a great breakfast hash.	Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender when pierced with sharp knife, about 25 minutes. Drain. Refrigerate potatoes overnight.@newline@Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes (do not peel). Whisk oil, vinegar, and mustard in small bowl to blend for vinaigrette.

565	Thai Rice Curry with Herbed Chicken (Khao Mok Gai)	Cinnamon sticks are made from long pieces of bark from various laurel trees that are rolled, pressed and dried. The type of cinnamon used in Thailand is from the Cassia tree. Cinnamon has a sweet, woody fragrance in both ground and stick forms. Rich in therapeutic essential oils, cinnamon warms the body and enhances digestion. It boosts metabolism and is thus useful for weight loss. It is also good for diabetes as it stimulates insulin production.	For Cucumber Relish: In a saucepan, bring vinegar and honey to a boil. Stir frequently until the honey has dissolved and continue to cook for 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat. Once cooled, add cucumber, chiles and coriander and stir well. Set aside until ready to serve.	7
566	Radish Addiction	When I was a kid, my sister and I would make a platter of these after school and eat them while watching pThe Brady Bunchp and pGilligan's Islandp. To this day, I can tell you the plot of any episode just by watching the first two seconds. I can also still eat a whole platter of these. Granted, they're nothing fancy, but they're always the first things to go. Try them when you're inviting a few friends over for beer on a hot summer's day.	Slice off the tips of the radishes so that the bottoms are flat. (They won't roll off the platter that way.) With a small sharp knife, cut a cone-shaped opening in the top of each radish. Fill with softened butter and sprinkle with kosher salt.@newline@That's it!	2
567	Stir-Fried Pumpkin with Chiles and Basil (Fakthong Pad Bai Horapa)	Pumpkin is a member of the gourd family. Its flesh is fibrous and firm, and has an earthy, sometimes sweet, taste. It is used in Asian cooking in a number of ways, both savory and sweet. When buying pumpkin check that the skin is not pitted and that the stem is still intact. Rich in beta-carotene, pumpkins can help protect the body against heart disease.	In a heavy wok, stir-fry garlic and onion using half of the vegetable stock, until browned. Add pumpkin cubes, moisten with remaining vegetable stock and stir constantly until pumpkin is cooked. Season with soy sauce, oyster sauce and honey. Sprinkle with Thai basil leaves and sliced red chile. Serve with brown rice.	1
568	Spiced and Sour Mushroom Soup (Tom Yam Hed)	NoDescription	In a saucepan, bring vegetable stock, shallots, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and chiles to a boil. Continue to boil for 4-5 minutes. Add oyster and straw mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. Once cooked remove from heat and season with miso paste, lime juice and apple concentrate.	8
569	Fuji Apple Spice Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting	Why Fujis? This not-too-sugary cake (inspired by carrot cake) is best when made with fairly sweet apples. Plus, it's important to choose an apple variety with a sturdy structure so that it won't break down during baking. Fuji apples fill the bill on both counts.	For cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch high sides. Line bottom of each pan with parchment paper round. Whisk first 7 ingredients in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat 1 cup butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add both sugars and beat until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla, then bourbon, if desired (mixture may look curdled). Add flour mixture to egg mixture in 3 additions alternately with applesauce in 2 additions, beating until blended after each addition. Stir in apples and pecans. Divide batter between cake pans; smooth tops.@newline@Bake cakes until tester inserted into center of each comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Transfer cakes to racks and cool in pans 15 minutes. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Invert cakes onto racks; peel off parchment paper. Place another rack atop 1 cake and invert again so that cake is rounded side up. Repeat with second cake. Cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap each cake in plastic and stoer at room temperature.	2
570	Homemade Bratwurst Bites with Beer and Horseradish Mustard	If you have a food processor, you can make sausage from scratch. Adding pork fat to the meat gives these bite-size sausage patties a tender texture. Call your butcher in advance to make sure he sets aside some extra pork fat for you. To help the mixture blend more easily, be sure to freeze the pork pieces before grinding them in the processor. Keep in mind that the sausage needs to chill overnight so that the flavors have time to develop.	Place pork sparerib cubes and pork fat in freezer until partially frozen, about 30 minutes. Place half of pork and half of pork fat in processor. Using on/off turns, blend mixture until finely ground. Transfer mixture to bowl. Repeat with remaining pork and pork fat. Gently mix sage and next 5 ingredients into ground pork mixture. Stir in 1/4 cup beer. Cover and chill overnight.@newline@Form pork mixture by tablespoonfuls into 1 1/4-to 1 1/2-inch-diameter patties; place on baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.@newline@Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches if necessary, add sausage patties to skillet and cook until browned on bottom, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup beer to skillet; cover with lid slightly ajar and cook until beer evaporates, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn patties over and cook until brown on bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.@newline@Transfer sausage patties to platter. Serve with Beer and Horseradish Mustard and soft pretzels.	1
571	Duck Breast & Zucchini Tournedos	With the little one's football team	For the mushroom powder, process the dried cep mushrooms until finely ground, combine them with the pepper and herbes de Provene.@newline@Cut the duck breasts lengthways into 3 mm ( inch) wide strips.@newline@Lay out the strips of duck two by two on top of each other, alternating layers of fat and lean. Cut the zucchini into strips using a vegetable peeler. Lay the strips of zucchini on top of the duck, season with the mushroom powder and season with salt. Roll up the strips tightly to make tournedos and tie with string. Make 6 tournedos in this way. Cook over gentle heat 5 minutes each side.	11
572	My Green Papaya Salad	Every Southeast asian country has some variation of green papaya or mango salad. Since it doesn't taste like much (nice texture, though), it's all about the supporting cast as far as delivering flavor goes. And in this version there's such a big cast that you can lose one or two items and the salad will still taste real good. You can even lose the papaya (shhhh) and make it with all the other goodies. Just don't lose the fish sauce, palm sugar, lime juice, or chilideal?p@newline@pLISTENp@newline@Mayafra Combo, "Iffilah Ha-Ha"Sonnie Taylor from Trinidad backed up by some Italian musicians. Beautiful vocals and a moving jazz-funk vibe to keep you dancing and cooking.p@newline@pDRINKp	MAKE THE DRESSING Use a mortar and pestle to pound all the dressing ingredients until smooth, pounding each ingredient thoroughly before adding the next. taste and add more fish sauce, lime juice, chili, and/or palm sugar if you want. The flavor's up to you.	2
573	Smoked-Chili-Rubbed Goat Shoulder	I'll barbecue the hell out of a goat: get the whole animal on the grill or do up just the head or maybe the legswhatever strikes my fancy. But the shoulder is probably my favorite cut to treat to hours and hours of gentle smoky caressing. This is party cooking, because (a) everyone will want some of this tender, spicy action and (b) though it takes a while to cook, you're only not sitting on your ass and drinking for, like, 10 minutes. The goat shoulder smokes for approximately seven hours. The smoking should be done in an indirect smoker (Texas-style chamber smoker). A temperature of 225F to 250F (a big variation, as smokers can be hard to control) should be maintained for 7 to 8 hours. The time variation is big, too, as there are so many smokers, and often backyard versions don't hold heat all that well. At a constant 250F, it should not take longer than 7 hours, but an understanding of the variable types of equipment should be acknowledged.p@newline@pLISTENp@newline@Idris Muhammad, Boogie to the Topa fun, funky album. My favorite tune is "Bread" ("B-R-E-A-D, that's what I said!"). Dance with your goat!p@newline@pDRINKp	THE DAY BEFORE 1. Use a mortar and pestle to pound the chilies, ginger, garlic, and parsley with the salt to a coarse paste, pounding each ingredient thoroughly before adding the next. Add the olive oil, pounding again to form a pretty smooth paste.@newline@2. Rub the goat shoulder with the chili paste and refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours.	4
574	Parboiled Rice	South Indian rice is parboiled during processing, which creates a more nutritious but harder grain that needs to be boiled like pasta for 40 minutes. The grains are puffy and separate, and they absorb the curries beautifully. Indian parboiled rice can be ordered from iShopIndian.com; but if this type is not available, American-style converted rice or regular long-grain white rice are both good substitutes. (North Indian basmati rice would not be served at a Sadhya.) This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring 3 to 4 quarts water to a boil in a pasta pot.@newline@Boil Indian parboiled rice, uncovered, until tender, about 45 minutes (converted or long-grain rice will take about 18 minutes). Drain well in a sieve and serve hot.	7
575	Sourdough Toasts with Mushrooms and Oysters	Redzepi uses whatever foraged mushrooms he finds to make this rich ragout; feel free to do the same while foraging at your local farmers' market or supermarket. Omit the oysters and lardo (used here in place of Speck), if desired.	Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 3 bread slices and toast until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter to skillet; turn bread and toast until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer toasts to a wire rack; let cool. Repeat with remaining 3 bread slices and 3 tablespoons butter. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.@newline@Wipe skillet clean. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saut, tossing frequently, until lightly colored but still firm, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and transfer one third of mushrooms to a plate. Add 2 tablespoons butter and cream to skillet. Bring to a simmer; cook until cream is very thick and mushrooms are well coated in sauce, 3-4 minutes. Stir in oysters, if using, and shallots and parsley.@newline@Divide toasts among plates; spoon mushroom mixture over. Top with reserved mushrooms. Lay 2 slices lardo over each toast, if using. Serve immediately.	8
576	Pot-Roasted Celery Root with Olives and Buttermilk	In this surprising main course, Redzepi pot-roasts whole celery roots. Be sure to use small celery roots; larger ones will not cook evenly. The chef also cooks small heads of cauliflower in this way.	Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add celery roots and cook, turning frequently, until golden, 8-10 minutes. Add butter and a large pinch of salt. When butter begins to foam, reduce heat to medium-low. Add herb sprigs, coffee beans, if using, and 1 1/2 cups water. Cover and gently cook, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if pan is dry, until celery roots are very tender, about 1 hour.@newline@Remove herbs and coffee beans (if using) from pot and discard. Baste celery roots with buttery juices in pot. Remove from heat. Transfer celery roots to a cutting board, slice in half through stems, and place 2 halves on each plate.@newline@Meanwhile, very gently warm buttermilk in a small saucepan over low heat (it will break if warmed too much). Squeeze in a few drops of lemon juice and add remaining 2 teaspoons oil and a pinch of salt to make a loose sauce. Spoon sauce around celery roots on plates. Garnish with olives, drizzle with oil, and squeeze a few more drops of lemon juice over each.	6
577	Chilaquiles with Fried Eggs	This Mexican dish of tortilla chips smothered in chile sauce is just as good for dinner as it is for breakfast. If you don't want to make your own chips, substitute your favorite brand, but don't skimp on the garnishes; they add color and freshness.	For red chile sauce: Place chiles in a medium bowl; cover with 2 cups boiling water. Let chiles soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain, reserving soaking liquid. Discard stems and seeds; place chiles in a blender. Add tomatoes, next 4 ingredients, and 1 cup reserved soaking liquid; pure until smooth.@newline@Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pure (it will splatter) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes (add more reserved soaking liquid if too thick). Stir in honey and season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before using.	6
578	Pappadams (Lentil Wafers)	In North India these legume wafers are called ppapadp and are dry-roasted over a flame, but in the South they are deep-fried until they form lots of air bubbles and become light and puffy. They are sold in many flavors, but plain is preferred in Kerala. Pappadams are always part of a Sadhya: You crush one up and mix it together with rice, dhal, and ghee. The pappadam helps to bind all the ingredients together so you can form balls when eating with your hand. Store-bought wafers are used almost exclusively by Indian cooks because the traditional recipes are labor-intensive and require days of drying in the hot sun. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a wok or 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until a tiny piece of pappadam dropped in oil quickly bobs to surface and expands (about 350F).@newline@Reduce heat to medium-high. Slip 1 pappadam into oil and let it expand to its full size and turn light brown, 10 to 30 seconds. Using tongs, flip it over quickly and fry other side until light brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining pappadams. (If pappadams don't expand immediately, oil is too cool; if they brown too quickly, oil is too hot.)	12
579	Spiced Rum No. 5	Martin Cate, owner of the rum-centric Smuggler's Cove bar in San Francisco, shares his spiced rum recipe below. The secret: Start with good rum, and don't overinfuse the mixture.	Combine 1 bottle (750 milliliters) medium-bodied aged rum (such as El Dorado 5 Year, Mount Gay Eclipse Black, or Appleton Estate V/X), 3 allspice berries, 3 cloves, 1 cardamom pod, 1 segment of a star anise pod, 1/2 cinnamon stick, and 1/8 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg in a lidded 1-quart jar. Twist a 4x1" strip of orange peel (no white pith) just above the mixture to release some of its oils; add peel to jar. Split 1/2 vanilla bean lengthwise; scrape seeds into jar and add bean. Cover jar tightly; shake to combine. Let sit in a dark place for 2 days, shaking once after first day. Strain mixture through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bottle; discard spices. Will keep indefinitely if sealed tightly and stored in a dark, dry place.	3
580	The Buckley	Ben Clemons, bartender at Bar 308 in Nashville, created this sage- and lime-infused cocktail for our story, pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p Cocchi Aperitivo Americano is an Italian aperitif wine beloved for its citrus, herbal, and bitter flavor profile. It's becoming easier to find, but if you can't locate a bottle, Clemons recommends substituting Lillet Blanc.	In a small pot, combine 20 sage leaves, sugar, and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil then lower heat to moderately low and simmer until aromatic and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Allow syrup to cool, then pour through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the sage. DO AHEAD: The sage simple syrup can be made in advance and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 1 week@newline@In a cocktail shaker, combine 3/4 ounce sage simple syrup with the gin, Cocchi Aperitivo Americano, and lime juice. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a chilled champagne coupe, then slowly add the Campari so that it settles at the bottom of the glass. Garnish with a fresh sage leaf.	10
581	Spinach in Yogurt Sauce	Pachadis are lightly cooked South Indian salads, often involving yogurt. This was my grandmother's recipe, and it remains a feature of my core repertoire because it's so simple and unusual at the same time. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 7 minutes. Add spinach, chile, 2 tablespoons water, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in yogurt.@newline@Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook mustard seeds until they begin to pop and/or turn gray, then add cumin seeds and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until cumin seeds brown, about 30 seconds more. Add curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately for a few seconds, then stir spice mixture into spinach mixture. Season with salt. Serve warm.	10
582	Vegetables  la Barigoule with Vanilla	Barigoule is typically a stew of artichokes. This version blends vegetables in a bit of vanilla-scented sauce.	Using a small sharp knife, cut all peel and white pith from lemon; discard. Cut flesh crosswise into 1/4"-thick slices; set aside.@newline@Line a large rimmed baking sheet with a kitchen towel. Cook broccoli in a large pot of boiling salted water for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat in same pot with carrots, onions, asparagus, and fennel, returning water to a boil between batches.@newline@Place chicken broth in a small saucepan over low heat and scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat; let infuse for 10 minutes.@newline@Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, onions, fennel, and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add coriander, next 3 ingredients, and infused broth with bean. Cover with lid slightly ajar; simmer until vegetables are crisp-tender, 12-15 minutes. Stir in broccoli and asparagus.@newline@Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a warm serving dish. Bring broth to a boil and cook until reduced to 1 cup. Remove broth from heat; whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and additional vinegar, if desired. Pour sauce over vegetables. Garnish with lemon slices and cilantro.	2
583	Ginger-Tamarind Chutney (Inji Puli)	This tart and spicy condiment is always served with a Sadhya feast. It is especially nice mixed with plain rice and yogurt as a palate cleanser. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium-low heat (coconut oil has a very low smoking point, so be careful not to let it get too hot). Add ginger and chile and cook, stirring, until ginger begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.@newline@Dissolve tamarind concentrate in 1/2 cup hot water.@newline@Heat remaining tablespoon coconut oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat, then cook mustard seeds until they begin to pop and/or turn gray. Add red pepper flakes and curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately, and stir until curry leaves are crisp.@newline@Add spice mixture to ginger mixture along with cayenne, asafetida, and salt and cook over medium heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add tamarind liquid and jaggery and simmer, stirring, until mixture becomes somewhat thick and syrupy, about 2 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.	8
584	Cheesy Corn Chowder	When both the recipe developer (Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez) and the cross-tester (Melissa Roberts) raved about this soup, it was clear we had a winner! This almost-vegetarian chowder is chock full of a variety of colorful diced vegetables. Of course, we love the smoky nuance the bacon gives it, but if you wanted to make this strictly vegetarian, just lose the bacon and use vegetable stock in place of the chicken broth. This is ski-house material to feed a hungry horde, or use a long weekend to have several smaller gatherings to pay back all your friends (once youve cleaned for one party, you might as well throw another one).	Cook bacon in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring frequently, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a small bowl.@newline@Pour off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat. Add onion, carrots, celery, and bell pepper to pot and cook, stirring, until onion is softened, 10 to 12 minutes.@newline@Add Yukon gold and sweet potatoes, broth, and water, and simmer, covered, until potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes. Add corn and cream and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.@newline@Remove pot from heat, then stir in cheese until melted. Season soup with salt and pepper and stir in bacon and basil. Garnish with fresh chives, scallions, or paprika (if desired).	2
585	Peach Prosecco	Sean Traynor, bartender at The Windsor in Phoenix, Arizona, created this crisp, beautifully hued cocktail for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p Sparkling wine is often used to top off a drink, but in this case Traynor mixes it with the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. The reason? He's using it more for its acidity and flavor than effervescence. For pure peach flavor, Traynor insists on a true peach-based liqueur, so put away the peach Schnapps; he recommends Sathenay Crme de Pche de Vigne Liqueur, Rothman & Winter Orchard Peach Liqueur, or Massenez Crme de Pche.	In a cocktail shaker, combine the vodka, peach liqueur, Prosecco, lemon juice, peach nectar, and bitters, if using. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a chilled champagne coupe and garnish with a peach wedge.	9
586	Crisp Okra in Yogurt Sauce	This coconut curry adds a tangy note to a South Indian menu. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat 6 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Fry okra, stirring occasionally, until well browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and season with 1 teaspoon salt.@newline@Pure coconut, 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chile in a blender or food processor with enough water (1/2 cup to 1 cup) to form a fine paste.@newline@Bring coconut paste and yogurt to a bare simmer in cleaned skillet, stirring, then remove from heat.@newline@Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook remaining 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds and red pepper flakes until mustard seeds begin to pop and/or turn gray. Add curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately as the leaves crackle for a few seconds. Stir spice mixture into coconut mixture in skillet, then stir in fried okra, then lemon juice. Season with salt.	9
587	Parmesan Shortbread with Fennel and Sea Salt	Any salty hard cheese, such as an aged Manchego, Grana Padano, or Mimolette, would be a fine substitute for the Parmesan. This recipe is from Caitlin Williams Freeman's upcoming cookbook, pThe Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee.	Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a medium bowl on low speed until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Add powdered sugar, pepper, and kosher salt. Reduce speed to medium and beat, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until light and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Add flour and cheese. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat mixture just until dough comes together.@newline@Wrap dough in plastic and flatten into a rectangle. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Dough can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before continuing.@newline@Place fennel seeds in a resealable plastic freezer bag. Coarsely crush with a rolling pin or the bottom of a skillet. Alternatively, pulse in a spice mill until coarsely crushed. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in sea salt. Set fennel salt aside.@newline@Arrange a rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove plastic wrap from dough. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10x8" rectangle about 1/4" thick. Cut in thirds crosswise, then cut each third crosswise into 6 rectangles. Arrange cookies on prepared baking sheet, spacing 1" apart. Brush cookies generously with oil, then sprinkle with fennel salt.@newline@Bake, rotating sheet halfway through, until cookies are golden brown (flecks of cheese will be slightly darker), 20-24 minutes. Let cool on sheets for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.	6
588	Indian Clarified Butter	South Indians don't use ghee in cooking the way North Indians do, much preferring their coconut oil. But they always have a spoonful with their parboiled rice and dhal. The first step of a Sadhya is mixing ghee, rice, dhal, crushed pappadam, and a little salt. This mixture is eaten by hand and forms the first bites of the Sadhya. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Line a sieve with 3 layers of cheesecloth and set over a jar.@newline@Bring butter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Once foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until a thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching closely and stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until milk solids on bottom of pan are light brown and liquid is golden, translucent, and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through cheesecloth-lined sieve into jar.	2
589	The Dandy Lion	Stephen Cole, bartender at The Barrelhouse Flat in Chicago, created this dressed-up take on the classic gin and tonic for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p While you should feel free to use your favorite gin, for this absinthe-laced cocktail, Cole suggests trying Hayman's Old Tom Gin, which is slightly sweeter than more traditional English dry gin.	In a cocktail shaker, muddle the cucumber until slightly broken up, about 20 seconds. Add the absinthe and let macerate for about 30 seconds. Add the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup, then fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass (or any tall glass tumbler), top with tonic, and garnish with a cucumber slice.	5
590	Shellfish and Potatoes  la Marinire	White wine and briny shellfish juices marry in the pot, then are pured with parsley to create a light sauce so flavorful, it needs only a touch of butter.	Place potatoes in a medium saucepan. Add cold water to cover by 2". Add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; set aside.@newline@Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add fennel, shallots, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat; add wine. Return pot to heat; increase heat to high, add littleneck clams, cover, and cook for 1 minute. Add mussels, cockles, razor clams (if using), and potatoes. Cover; cook until all shellfish have opened (discard any that do not open), 4-5 minutes longer.@newline@Using a slotted spoon, transfer shellfish and potatoes to a warm bowl and transfer any remaining vegetables from pot to a blender. Pour liquid from pot into blender, leaving any sediment behind. Add 1 cup parsley and butter to blender; pure on high until sauce is bright green and thickened, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over shellfish; stir to coat. Garnish with whole parsley leaves.	1
591	Rhubarb Collins	Jasper Soffer, bartender at the Mulberry Project in New York City, created this simple-to-prepare seasonal cocktail for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p The rhubarb simple syrup, Soffer explains, is simultaneously sweet and tart, not unlike a rhubarb-apple crumble or a strawberry-rhubarb pie. If you want to make this drink outside rhubarb's short early-spring season, frozen fruit makes a great substitute.	In a small pot, combine the rhubarb and sugar with 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until slightly thickened and bright pink in color, about 20 minutes. Let the syrup cool then pour through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Press down gently and discard the solids. DO AHEAD: The rhubarb simple syrup can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.@newline@In a cocktail shaker, combine 1 ounce of the rhubarb simple syrup with the gin and lemon juice. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a highball glass and top with Champagne or soda water.	5
592	Kona Swizzle	Sure, you can mix it with cola, but we prefer our spiced rum in a proper cocktail like the Kona Swizzle, a floral riff on the classic Queen's Park Swizzle, Created by New York city bartender Brian Miller.	Gently muddle (or mix with a swizzle stick) 1/4 cup spiced rum (or try Chairman's Reserve Spiced Rum), 4 1/2 teaspoons orgeat syrup (such as Brooklyn Orgeat Works or Monin), 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 1 teaspoon simple syrup, and 2 mint sprigs in a cocktail shaker. Cover and shake well. Pour into a Pilsner or Collins glass. Fill glass halfway with crushed ice, pushing mint toward bottom of the glass. Stir with a swizzle stick. Top with more crushed ice, mounding over rim of the glass. Top with 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters and 1 dash Angostura bitters. Garnish with 2 mint sprigs.	2
593	Hoisin-Glazed Meatloaf Sandwiches	Delicious on its own, this thoroughly modern meatloaf takes on a terrine-like texture when chilled overnight, just right for deluxe open-face sandwiches with a <am>banh mi-like flavor profile.</am>	For hoisin glaze: Bring all ingredients to a boil in a medium saucepan; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens to a glaze, 8-10 minutes.	11
594	Roasted Pineapple with Honey and Pistachios	Caramelized pineapple with a honey-orange glaze makes for a quick and elegant weeknight dessert.	Preheat oven to 450F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir first 3 ingredients in a large bowl until sugar dissolves. Add pineapple; toss to coat. Let marinate, tossing occasionally, for 10 minutes. Place pineapple, one flat side down, on prepared sheet; reserve marinade.@newline@Roast pineapple for 15 minutes. Turn, brush with marinade, and roast until tender and caramelized, 10-15 minutes. Drizzle remaining marinade over; let cool slightly.@newline@Divide pineapple among plates. Spoon crme frache alongside. Garnish with nuts and mint.	8
595	A Green Peas Soup, without Meat	This Mary Kettilby recipe produces a classic Potage St. Germain. The name comes from the Paris suburb of St.-Germain-en-Laye, where young peas, a rarity in the early eighteenth century, were sown in boxes for early-spring cultivation. The addition of onions and spinach provide a traditional French touch, making this soup a flavorsome beginning for spring menu.p	1. Put 8 cups of the peas and 4 cups of the water in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add the salt, pepper, mace, cloves, thyme, and marjoram, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the peas are very tender.@newline@2. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid in the sauceupan. Puree the peas in a food processor or with a food mill. If using a food mill, discard the skins. Press the puree through a sieve into the reserved liquid, stirring to combine thoroughly. Cover and set aside to keep warm.@newline@3. Combine the remaining 2 cups of peas with the remaining 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the peas are just tender.@newline@4. While the second batch of peas is cooking, melt the butter in a saut pan. Add the green onions, and saut for about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and mint and stir together, cooking until the spinach has just wilted. Blend in the flour, and cook for about 1 minute.@newline@5. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid, and stir the peas into the warm soup along with the spinach mixture. Heat until it begins to simmer, adding the reserved pea-cooking liquida little at a timeif the soup is too thick. Season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.@newline@6. Pour the soup into a tureen, and garnish with diced toast and shredded calendula blossoms, if desired.	1
596	Chocolate Sponge Cake	Sometimes we spread jam between the layers; other times we simply dust the cake with powdered sugar.	For cake: Preheat oven to 400F. Line the bottom of a 13x9x2" metal baking pan with parchment paper. Butter paper and sides of pan; dust with cocoa powder, tapping out excess. Sift flour and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Repeat sifting 2 more times. Set flour mixture aside. Crack 2 eggs into a large deep bowl. Separate remaining 2 eggs, adding yolks to bowl with whole eggs and placing whites in a medium deep bowl. Set whites aside.@newline@Using an electric mixer, beat whole eggs and yolks on low speed for 1 minute. Increase speed to medium; gradually add 1/2 cup sugar. Beat until mixture is thick and pale, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla.@newline@Using clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites until foamy. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over. Continue to beat until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Sprinkle remaining 5 teaspoons sugar over and beat until meringue is thick and glossy, about 30 seconds.@newline@Using a rubber spatula, fold half of meringue into egg mixture. Sift half of dry ingredients over batter and fold until just blended. Repeat with remaining meringue and dry ingredients.@newline@Scrape batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly to edges. Bake until cake springs back when pressed gently with your fingertips, 10-12 minutes.@newline@Let cake cool in pan on a wire rack. Run a knife around sides of pan to release cake.@newline@Place a cutting board on top of pan. Invert cake onto board; remove pan. Carefully peel away parchment. Using a serrated knife, trim edges to create an even layer.	6
597	Seasoned Dhal (Masala Dhal)	Often the dhal served at a Sadhya is very plain, but I happen to like interesting dhals, like this recipe. Here I use small orange lentils (called "red" in stores) because they cook down into a creamy texture. I enrich it with coconut milk, and finish it with cilantro, lemon, and whole toasted seeds. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring lentils and 3 cups water to a boil with turmeric in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then gently simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until falling apart, about 20 minutes.@newline@When lentils are cooked, heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and red pepper flakes until mustard seeds begin to pop and/or turn gray and cumin seeds brown, about 1 minute. Stir spice mixture into lentils with coconut milk, cilantro, lemon juice, and salt and bring to a simmer.	7
598	Mussels with Fennel and Lovage	When gooseberries are in season, Redzepi juices them to flavor this dish. Verjus (a tart bottled juice made from unripe grapes) or a combination of white grape juice and cider vinegar make great substitutes.	Heat a large heavy pot over high heat until very hot. Add mussels, fennel, verjus, and wine. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until mussels fully open (discard any that do not open). Using a slotted spoon, transfer mussels and fennel to a serving platter.@newline@Simmer liquid in pot for 1 minute; whisk in butter and 1/2 cup lovage leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper (and additional vinegar if using grape juice). Spoon over mussels, leaving any sediment behind. Garnish mussels with remaining 1/2 cup lovage leaves and serve immediately.	12
599	Seasoned Lentil Stew	This aromatic mixture of split peas and vegetables is a staple in the South Indian diet. It always accompanies favorite snacks such as dosas (lentil crpes) and idlis (lentil dumplings). A traditional Sadhya feast wouldn't be complete without this flavorful source of protein. Asafetida (a garlicky resin from the sap of a fennel-like plant; it's often used in lentil dishes) and fenugreek provide its pleasantly pungent aroma. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring dal, 1 1/2 cups water, and turmeric to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to very low and cook, covered (check occasionally, and if mixture appears dried out, add up to about 1/4 cup water), until peas are soft and break when pressed with a spoon, about 30 minutes (45 minutes if using split peas).@newline@Meanwhile, dissolve tamarind concentrate in 2 tablespoons hot water, breaking it up with your fingers.@newline@Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook fenugreek seeds and asafetida, stirring, until fenugreek seeds begin to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining 2 cups water, potato, vegetables, chile, cilantro, sambar powder, tamarind mixture, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, until all vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.@newline@Mash dal in saucepan with a potato masher or back of a spoon to form a coarse paste, then stir into vegetable mixture. Simmer 10 minutes, stirring in water as necessary to thin (consistency should be thinner than pea soup). Season with salt and lemon juice.	6
600	Pickled Pears	We love the way these quickly pickled, supercrisp pears play off the briny and intense kimchi.	Combine all ingredients except pear in a small saucepan. Add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes to meld flavors. Remove from heat and let sit until warm.@newline@Place pear cubes in a 12-ounce jar with a tight-sealing lid. Add warm pickling liquid. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.	11
601	Chocolate Chip Cookies	Crunchy edges and soft centers make Lahey's cookies a classic.	Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 425F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder in a small bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and both sugars in a large bowl until well combined, 23 minutes. Add egg and vanilla; beat on medium-high speed until mixture is light and fluffy, 23 minutes. Add dry ingredients, reduce speed to low, and mix just to blend. Fold in chocolate chips.@newline@Spoon heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 1/2" apart. Bake, rotating pans halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 68 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.@newline@DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature, or freeze cookies for up to 2 months.	7
602	Kimchi Fritters with Soy Dipping Sauce	Korean pickled cabbage, a.k.a. kimchi, provides the spice in these savory fritters, while soaked raw mung beans hold the flourless pancakes together. They're great with or without the dipping sauce and pickled pears.	Mix 1 tablespoon scallion, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, vinegar, and gochugaru in a small bowl. Set dipping sauce aside.@newline@Mix pork, 1 teaspoon garlic, sesame oil, and remaining 1 teaspoon soy sauce in a small bowl. Chill for 30 minutes or up to 1 day.@newline@Drain beans, reserving 1 cup soaking liquid. Pure beans and 1/2 cup soaking liquid in a blender, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if necessary, until mixture is a thick, slightly chunky paste. Transfer to a large bowl. Add 3/4 cup scallions, 1 teaspoon garlic, kimchi, and chile to bean pure. Mix well; season batter with salt. Stir in pork mixture.@newline@Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, spoon 1/4-cupfuls of batter into skillet, spreading each out to 3 1/2"-4" rounds. Cook, adjusting heat if browning too quickly and adding more oil between batches, until fritters are golden brown and cooked through, 2-3 minutes per side.@newline@Serve pancakes with dipping sauce and Pickled Pears.	9
603	Classic Salad	We use fresh lemon juice for this vinaigrette as often as we do vinegar.	Using a wooden spoon, mash garlic, anchovy, and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in vinegar, then 1/4 cup oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more oil, if desired. Add lettuce leaves and chives just before serving and toss to coat.	2
604	Wasabi Salmon with Bok Choy, Green Cabbage, and Shiitakes	Save time by purchasing sliced stemmed shiitake mushrooms and wasabi paste in a tube. If the paste isn't available, mix 2 teaspoons wasabi powder with 1 tablespoon water.	Preheat oven to 450F. Heat a large rimmed baking sheet for 15 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and wasabi in a small bowl. Stir in half of ginger and half of garlic; set aside. Season fish all over with salt and pepper. Place bok choy, cabbage, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Drizzle with oil and add remaining ginger and garlic. Toss to coat; season with salt and pepper.@newline@Scatter vegetables across one side of baking sheet. Arrange salmon on other side. Roast, stirring vegetables occasionally, until salmon is cooked through, 12-15 minutes. Divide vegetables among plates; top with salmon. Serve wasabi mayonnaise alongside.	11
605	Paccheri and Cheese with Peas and Mint	Featuring paccheri rigati, a ribbed, tube-shaped pasta, this over-the-top casserole cooks in a 9"-diameter springform pan. But feel free to use rigatoni and a 9x9x2" baking dish instead.	Butter pan. Dust pan all over with 1/3 cup Parmesan. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; whisk for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a simmer, whisking often. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, whisking frequently, until sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in Fontina and 1 cup Parmesan. Add egg; whisk to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Cover sauce and keep warm.@newline@Arrange a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 375F. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until almost al dente (pasta will continue to cook while baking). Using a large slotted spoon, transfer pasta to a large bowl. Add peas to pasta water; cook until just tender, about 1 minute. Drain peas; add to bowl with pasta. Stir in cheese sauce. Add arugula, 1 cup parsley, and 1/2 cup mint to pasta mixture; mix to evenly incorporate.@newline@Transfer half of pasta mixture to prepared pan. Mix ricotta and lemon zest in a small bowl; dot half of ricotta mixture over pasta. Spoon remaining pasta mixture into pan and dot with remaining ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan.@newline@Bake pasta for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Bake pasta until top is golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Let rest for 30 minutes; remove pan sides. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons parsley and 2 tablespoons mint and cut into wedges.	4
606	Cardamom Rice Pudding (Payasam)	This is the South Indian equivalent of cake: essential at every wedding, birthday, and holiday. Indians like to serve it warm and soupy. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring milk, rice, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Add sugar and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.@newline@Heat ghee in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then cook almonds, stirring, until golden. Add raisins and cook, stirring, until coated with ghee and slightly puffed.@newline@Stir almond mixture into rice pudding and serve warm.	7
607	No-Knead Pizza Dough	This dough is chewy, bubbly, and better than what you'll get at most pizza places. It bakes wonderfully in a home oven, on a pizza stone or a baking sheet. And thanks to the brilliant no-knead method of Jim Laheyowner of New York's Sullivan Street Bakery and pizza spot Co. it's easy to prepare, deriving its character from overnight fermentation, not laborious kneading. Just remember to start at least 1 day ahead.	Whisk flour, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add 3 cups water; stir until well incorporated. Mix dough gently with your hands to bring it together and form into a rough ball. Transfer to a large clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature (about 72F) in a draft- free area until surface is covered with tiny bubbles and dough has more than doubled in size, about 18 hours (time will vary depending on the temperature in the room).@newline@Transfer dough to a floured work surface. Gently shape into a rough rectangle. Divide into 6 equal portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, gather 4 corners to center to create 4 folds. Turn seam side down and mold gently into a ball. Dust dough with flour; set aside on work surface or a floured baking sheet. Repeat with remaining portions.@newline@Let dough rest, covered with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel, until soft and pliable, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap each dough ball separately in plastic wrap and chill. Unwrap and let rest at room temperature on a lightly floured work surface, covered with plastic wrap, for 2-3 hours before shaping.	8
608	Sweet Potato with Toasted Coconut	Erisherisp are thick curries traditionally made with yams or pumpkin, toasted coconut, and whole kidney beans. They are hearty and earthy, with a tropical twist of coconut and curry leaves. My variation, made with sweet potatoes, crosses over beautifully to a fall or winter menu; I've even served it for Thanksgiving. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring sweet potatoes and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil with turmeric, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt in a 3-quart saucepan, then simmer, covered, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, toast coconut in a small heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very toasted (pale reddish-brown all over; be careful not to burn). Transfer to a plate.@newline@Break sweet potatoes up with the back of a spoon so that some chunks remain. Add toasted coconut, beans, garlic, cumin, chile, and remaining 1/2 cup water and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. If mixture becomes too thick and begins to stick to bottom of saucepan, add more water.@newline@Heat oil in cleaned small heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add mustard seeds, and cook until seeds begin to pop and/or turn gray. Add red pepper flakes and curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately and cooking just long enough for leaves to crackle. Stir spice mixture into sweet potato mixture (it will be very thick and chunky). Season with salt.	11
609	Chorizo and Gigante Bean Cassoulet	Pork and beans never had it so good. This Spanish riff on French cassoulet pairs large, meaty beans with fresh sausages under a breadcrumb crust. Save time by quick-soaking the beans.	For beans and chorizo: Place beans in a large pot and cover with water by 3". Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.@newline@Drain beans. Add fresh water to cover by 3". Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until beans are just tender but not mushy, 1 1/2-2 hours (time will vary depending on size and age of beans). Drain, reserving 1 cup bean broth.@newline@Preheat oven to 450F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook, turning occasionally, until golden all over, 7-8 minutes. Transfer chorizo to a plate and set aside.@newline@Place 2 tablespoons oil, leek, and onion in same pot. Season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and light golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and anchovies; stir 1 minute to break down anchovies. Add tomato paste and paprika; stir constantly until paste is caramelized, about 2 minutes. Add reserved 1 cup bean broth, beans, chicken broth, and next 4 ingredients; bring to a boil.@newline@Cover and bake until beans are very tender, about 30 minutes. Add chorizo (and any accumulated juices) to pot, pressing to submerge. Bake until liquid is reduced and slightly thickened, 40-45 minutes longer.	2
610	Black Sesame-Pear Tea Cake	Finely ground black sesame seeds create a deeply flavored and dramatically hued cake.	Preheat oven to 325F. Butter one 9x5x3" loaf pan or six 4x2x2" paper or metal loaf pans. Whisk 1 1/2 cups flour, next 4 ingredients, and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds in a medium bowl.

Toss pear with remaining 2 tablespoons flour in a small bowl; fold into batter.@newline@Spoon batter into prepared pan; smooth top. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.@newline@Bake until a tester comes out clean when inserted into center, about 1 hour 40 minutes for large loaf and 45-55 minutes for small loaves. Let cool in pans on a wire rack.	9
611	Blackberry, Lemon, and Thyme Muffins	Bake in large decorative paper molds (found at kitchen supply stores), or simply line standard muffin tins with your favorite liners.	For crumble: Whisk first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Add butter. Using your fingertips, rub in butter until pea-size lumps form. Add egg yolk; stir to evenly distribute and form moist clumps. (Crumble should resemble a mixture of pebbles and sand.) Chill for at least 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.	6
612	Sweet and Spicy Chicken Drumsticks	Chicken wings also work well here. Use 3 pounds, and skip the rice flour and cornstarch coating.	Bring Sriracha, rice vinegar, mirin, and jelly to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, adjusting heat if necessary, until mixture is thick and reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.@newline@Place drumsticks in a large bowl and season generously with salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450F.

Return drumsticks to rack and roast, turning once, until skin is crisp and sauce is beginning to brown, 8-9 minutes. Brush with additional sauce and serve remaining sauce alongside.	11
613	To Make an Excellent Cherry Bounce	Among the few recipes known to have been used by the Washington family is this one for cherry bounce, a brandy-based drink popular in the eighteenth century. It seems to have been such a favorite of General Washington's that he packed a "Canteen" of it, along with Madeira and port, for a trip west across the Allegheny Mountains in September 1784.p	1. Pit the cherries, cut them in half, and put them in a large bowl. Using a potato masher, carefully mash the fruit to extract as much juice as possible. Strain the juice through a large fine-mesh strainer, pressing the fruit with a sturdy spoon. (You should have about 8 cups.) Reserve the mashed cherries in the freezer or refrigerator for later use. If using jarred cherries, drain the fruit and set the juice aside before halving and mashing the cherries. Add any pressed juice to the reserved jarred juice.@newline@2. In a lidded 1-gallon glass jar, combine the juice with the brandy and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover with the lid, and set aside in the refrigerator for 24 hours, occasionally stirring or carefully shaking the jar.@newline@3. Bring 2 cups of the juice to a simmer over medium heat. Taste the sweetened juice and add more sugar, if desired. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, cloves, and nutmeg. Then cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Strain, and discard the spices.@newline@4. Stir the spiced juice back into the 1-gallon glass jar with the reserved sweetened juice. Cover loosely with the lid, and set aside for at least 2 weeks before serving, occasionally shaking the jar with care.@newline@5. Serve at room temperature in small cordial or wine glasses. Store the remaining cherry bounce in the refrigerator.	7
614	Chocolate-Peanut Butter Fun Cake	This chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting gets a generous (and fun!) garnish of chopped chocolate and peanuts.	For chocolate cake: Preheat oven to 350F. Coat bottom and sides of pan with nonstick spray; line bottom of pan with parchment paper. Whisk flour and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Add oil, vanilla, and 1 1/4 cups water; whisk until smooth. Fold in chopped chocolate. Scrape into prepared pan; smooth top. Bake until a tester comes out clean when inserted into center, 35-40 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on a wire rack.	4
615	Mixed Vegetables with Coconut Sauce (Aviyal)	This quintessential Kerala vegetable curry marries many of the best ingredients of the region: coconut, curry leaves, green chiles, and a host of tropical vegetables. All the vegetables are cut into batons and poached in a spiced yogurt-coconut sauce. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring potatoes, carrots, chile, red pepper flakes, turmeric, 1 cup water, and salt to a boil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot, then simmer briskly, uncovered, until vegetables are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and peas and simmer 1 minute more.@newline@Meanwhile, blend coconut, cumin, cayenne, and remaining 3/4 cup water in a blender or food processor to a medium-fine paste.@newline@Add coconut mixture to vegetable mixture along with yogurt. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and flavors have blended, 12 to 15 minutes. If mixture becomes too thick to simmer, add more water.@newline@Serve sprinkled with curry leaves and drizzled with coconut oil, if desired.	4
616	Popeye Pie	This pizza is one of my most popular dishes, a kind of warm spinach salad on a crust. I've been serving it since the earliest days at Sullivan Street (its originshow I came to make itare now lost in the mists of memory). But, even today, to the best of my knowledge, I'm the only one who offers it. Try it at home, and right after that first bite, you'll see why it's one of the most popular pies I've ever devised. When I make the Popeye in my home kitchen, I deviate from the usual system in this book and bake it (as called for here) rather than placing it under the broiler. The image of that mound of spinach directly under flame just seems wrongI'm not even sure what would happen, but it wouldn't be good.	1 Place the pizza stone in a gas oven on the middle rack. Preheat the oven on bake at 500F for 30 minutes. Switch to broil for 10 minutes and then back to bake at 500F. (For an electric variation, see Cooks' Note.)@newline@2 With the dough on the peel, sprinkle the surface evenly with the garlic. Distribute the pecorino, Gruyre, and mozzarella evenly over the dough. Sprinkle evenly with pepper.@newline@3 With quick, jerking motions, slide the pie onto the stone. Bake for 2 minutes.@newline@4 Pull the rack partially out of the oven. Quickly add the spinach in what will look like a big mound (the spinach will reduce, the mound flattening, as spinach always does when it cooks). Sprinkle evenly with salt. Return the pie to the oven for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes in a gas oven (somewhat longer with an electric oven; see Cooks' Note), until the crust is charred in spots, but not as deeply as with the other pizzas in this book.@newline@5 Using the peel, transfer the pizza to a tray or serving platter. Drizzle evenly with oil. Slice and serve immediately.	11
617	Arya's Snitched Tarts	She filched one anyway, and ate it on her way out. It was stuffed with chopped nuts and fruit and cheese, the crust flaky and still warm from the oven. Eating Ser Amory's tart made Arya feel daring.p Barefoot surefoot lightfoot_, she sang under her breath. I am the ghost in Harrenhal._ pA Clash of Kingsp@newline@pMedieval Arya Tartp@newline@These tarts take a while to make, but they are worth every minute. The pastries look like one could easily overindulge, but each small shortbread cookie is a commitment. The fruit syrup is heavy and chewy; our British readers may recognize this dessert as the medieval ancestor of the Jammie Dodger.p	Bring the wine and honey to a boil, then reduce the heat and skim off the foam until the liquid is clear. Add the vinegar, poudre forte, and fruits; return the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Keep an eye on the fruit as you proceeddo not overreduce it! The syrup should lightly coat the back of a spoon and reduce by about a third to a half.@newline@Roll the sweet dough to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured board, then use a circular cutter or drinking glass to cut out circles about 2 inches in diameter.@newline@Pour a shallow layer of oil into a skillet or pan and place it over medium-high heat until hot. Working a few at a time, gently slip dough circles into the oil and fry until they are lightly browned and very crisp. Transfer the fried circles to paper towels to drain. Arrange the cakes on a serving platter, then spoon on just enough of the fruit mixture to cover each disk. Sprinkle with candied nuts. The yellowish cakes and the red topping make an interesting contrast in colors, and the wine will soften the cakes.	2
618	Edible Stones	NoDescription	The garlic confit Pour the oil into a small, deep saucepan and place on the cooker (stove) top or over very low and steady heat, making sure it does not reach a very high temperature. Heating the oil can also be done over the edge of the cooker top so that it is done as gently as possible. When the oil is warm, place the separated, unpeeled garlic cloves in the oil and poach them gently for approximately 2 hours. They should be tender, easy to peel and thoroughly impregnated with oil. When ready, drain the oil, peel the garlic cloves, crush them, then pass them through a chinois and set aside.	8
619	Tyroshi Honeyfingers	"[W]e seldom had enough coin to buy anything . . . well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers...do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?"p pA Game of Thronesp@newline@pRoman Honeyfingersp@newline@This recipe is a curiosity. The honeyfingers fry to a crispy crunch on the outside while remaining a bit chewy on the inside. The pieces are easy to cut into shapes, and could probably even be rolled into logs. The flavor is really all about the honey, but the pepper and cinnamon on top, as well as the pine nuts, add a slight complexity.p	In a medium saucepan, whisk the 2/3 cup flour a little at a time into the cold milk so that there are no lumps. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the sherry, and cook on medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until a thick porridge forms. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir briskly to cool the mixture.@newline@When the porridge is lukewarm, add the egg and stir briskly until it is blended. Stir in the pine nuts and a dash of cinnamon and pepper. Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup flour to make a dough that is sticky but can still be handled.@newline@On a floured board with floured hands, press the dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle; cut it into finger-size strips.@newline@Cover the bottom of a frying pan with a layer of olive oil about 1/2 inch deep. Heat the oil and fry the strips of dough until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the fried strips to a plate covered with paper towels to drain. Dip them in honey and sprinkle them with cinnamon and pine nuts.	3
620	Vanilla Extract	NoDescription	1. Fill a mason jar or bottle with vodka. After you use the seeds of a vanilla bean in a recipe, rinse off the vanilla bean and put it in the vodka. You'll need at least 3 vanilla beans in there for at least 3 weeks to get a good extract going, but it's fine to use more beans, too. Your extract is ready when it is a lovely brown color and it smells like vanilla.@newline@2. Either pour the extract it into a new bottle and start over or keep topping off the working bottle with vodka and keep shoving more vanilla beans into the bottle. As long as you don't let it get too empty, you can keep using the extract indefinitely even as you continue to top it off.	7
621	Smoked Scotch Eggs	Sausage-wrapped "Scotch" eggs are a tasty and interesting dish when breaded and fried in the traditional manner, but cooking them on the smoker makes a very special treat. The homemade sausage gets a nice crust on the outside and, if you get it cooked just right, the egg yolk will have a little bit of ooze on the inside. Just make sure to seal the sausage all the way around the egg before smoking. I like to serve these as an appetizer, but they are also fine as a nice smoked addition to a lunch salad.	Put the eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Let rest for 15 minutes to warm them up before cooking. (This will help keep them from cracking.) Over high heat, bring the eggs to a boil, rolling them around in the pot frequently. When the water begins to boil, start timing and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to roll the eggs around in the pan. (This will keep the yolks in the center.) Remove the eggs from the boiling water quickly and submerge them in ice water to stop the cooking. When the eggs are cool, peel them and refrigerate.@newline@Put the pork in a medium bowl and add the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne. Mix well and then divide the sausage into six equal portions. On waxed paper, flatten out one of the portions to a 4-inch circle. Top with an egg and wrap the sausage all around the egg, stretching as needed and sealing it completely. Do this with all the eggs and then season them liberally with the rub. Put the eggs on a pan lined with wax paper and refrigerate for 1 hour.@newline@Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor.@newline@Place the eggs on a grill topper or directly on the cooking grate and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden brown and firm to the touch.@newline@Transfer the eggs to a plate and let cool. Cut them in halves or quarters and serve with barbecue sauce for dipping.	12
622	Dubonnet Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the red option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. Dubonnet takes center stage in Frizell's Sangria but is a supporting player in many classic cocktail recipes, including the gin-based Dubonnet cocktail (also known as the Zaza). It's an aperitif wine that Frizell says is similar to vermouth and has been popular in French cafs since the 19th century.	In a large bowl, combine the orange wedges, lemon quarters, Cognac, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Using a muddler or a wooden spoon, press down on the fruit mixture until the juice is released and the sugar is dissolved. Add the Dubonnet and stir to combine. Strain the mixture into a large pitcher and discard the fruit. Add the orange half wheels, lemon slices, and bitters, if using. Stir gently to combine then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. When ready to serve, add the sparkling water, then carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Taste and add additional sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary.	2
623	Cucumber-Vermouth Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the blue option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. The drink gets its oceanlike hue from just 1 ounce of blue curaao, but if color isn't important to you, feel free to use regular (clear) curaao instead. Frizell warns against using cheap vermouth: "An excellent dry vermouth, like Dolin, is necessary for this recipe." The drizzle of Maraschino liqueur, Frizell explains, "adds a nutty, bittersweet note."	In a large pitcher, combine the lemon slices, cucumber slices, and vermouth. Stir gently then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. When ready to serve, add the curaao, simple syrup, lemon juice, gin, sparkling water, and Maraschino liqueur, if using. Carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Garnish glasses with mint, plus additional lemon and cucumber slices.	6
624	Pineapple Sangria	St. John Frizell of pFort Defiancep in Red Hook, Brooklyn, created this recipe for a pFourth of July drinksp featurethis is the white option in a special red, white, and blue Sangria series. For this Caribbean-inspired pitcher drink, Frizell recommends using good white rum or, even better, a mix of white rum and aged rum. "A funky aged Jamaican rum, like Smith & Cross, will add a profound depth of flavor to the mix," he notes. For the wine, Frizell says to use a young unoaked white, such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a dry Riesling.	In a large pitcher, combine 2 cups pineapple, white wine, simple syrup, and rum. Stir gently then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, add the coconut water, lime juice, lime slices, and sparkling water. Add the Maraschino liqueur, if using, then carefully fill the pitcher with ice and stir to combine. Garnish glasses with the remaining pineapple, if desired, or add the fruit to the pitcher.	10
625	Bacon-Wrapped Pig Wings	Who says pigs can't fly? Take a few boneless pork chops, add some bacon and a little creativity, and Pig Wings are on the menu! The bacon adds great flavor and keeps the loin meat from getting dry. These look delicious and are a little unusual, so they make a fabulous smoked appetizer with barbecue sauce for dipping. The kids will love them.	Cut each pork chop into three strips. To wrap the "wings," start by overlapping the bacon on one end of a pork strip, then wrapping it up and around in a candy-cane fashion. Secure the bacon at the top with a toothpick. If you need to use a toothpick at both ends, go ahead. Season the bacon-wrapped wings liberally with the rub.@newline@Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor. Place the wings directly on the cooking grid and cook for 90 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked. You may want to finish these on a hot grill or under the broiler to crisp the bacon. Serve hot with barbecue sauce for dipping.	1
626	Seitan Flares	If you like hot wings, I mean really, really like HOT wings, try this grilled version made with seitan! Boasting the same texture and pknock you on your assp flavors as regular hot wings, especially when you pile on the cayenne, you won't miss a beat.	Heat the grill to medium-high.@newline@Prepare the seitan: Marinate the seitan in the olive oil to cover for 1 hour. Grill the seitan until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes or longer, turning often. Transfer to a bowl.@newline@Meanwhile, make the sauce, if using: In a glass measure, whisk together the hot sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, salt, and cayenne pepper to taste. Microwave the mixture for 1 minute or until fairly hot, or whisk the mixture together in a small saucepan and place it over direct heat on the grill until it is hot, 4 to 5 minutes, or longer depending on the grill. Add the mixture to the seitan bowl and stir gently to combine, or coat the seitan if it is skewered. Finish with the optional oregano. Serve with extra sauce and celery sticks.	10
627	Shiny Happy Poppers	Nothing puts a smile on people's faces faster while at the same time setting their tongues ablaze, like these grilled jalapeo poppers. Sans cheese, and debuting with a snazzy new look, these Shiny Happy Poppers are every bit a modern twist on what still remains a classic firebrand when it comes to pregame appetizers. However, a word to the wise: Having an ice-cold beer nearby is highly recommended, should this blaze get out of control.	Heat the grill to medium-high.@newline@Stem the jalapeos and cut one lengthwise slit in each pepper. Pull out the seeds and inner ribs with your fingers (wear rubber gloves if your skin is sensitive to handling hot peppers).@newline@In a medium-size bowl, combine the rice, black beans, mustard, garlic powder, and thyme. Stir until well mixed.@newline@With an appropriately sized spoon, fill the jalapeos with the rice mixture. Place the peppers on a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Drizzle the peppers with the olive oil and then with the hot sauce, to taste.@newline@Fold the foil into a packet with the peppers in one layer. Grill the packet for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the peppers are soft and the rice filling is hot. Serve at once.	11
628	Malted Vanilla Ice Cream with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces	Chilling Time: 2 hours or overnightp@newline@Shelf Life: 1 weekp	Make the base 1. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks just to break them up, then whisk in the malted milk powder. Set aside.@newline@2. In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, stir together the cream, milk, sugar, and salt and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture approaches a bare simmer, reduce the heat to medium.@newline@3. Carefully scoop out about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another 1/2 cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.@newline@4. Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula, 1 to 2 minutes longer.@newline@5. Strain the base through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container. Set the container into an ice-water bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the base for at least 2 hours or overnight.	7
629	String Bean & Arugula Salad	In this unusual pairing, the string beans and baby arugula work wonders for each other. Wilting the arugula with the hot, garlicky grilled beans is a nice trick for bringing the two together. While you can use regular arugula if you must, baby arugula is far milder in flavor, so try to find it if you can.	Heat the grill to medium-high.@newline@In a large bowl, toss the string beans with the olive oil and garlic. Let the beans rest for 10 minutes or so, then place the beans on a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Fold the foil over the beans and fold down the ends of the foil twice. Place the foil packet on the grill, seam side up, and grill for 25 to 30 minutes. Let the beans cool for a few minutes, then combine them in a roomy bowl with the arugula, lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing until the arugula is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.	7
630	Tequila-Lime Mahimahi Tacos	Mild mahimahi takes on the flavors of our zesty marinade.	In a resealable plastic bag, combine 3 tablespoons lime juice, tequila, 1 tablespoons cilantro, garlic and cumin. Add fish, seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate, turning once, 1 hour. In a bowl, combine vinegar, oil, 2 teaspoons honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add cabbage; toss well. In another bowl, combine sour cream, milk, zest, remaining 1 tbsp juice, remaining 3/4 teaspoon honey and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat grill. Remove fish from marinade; season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill, turning once, until just cooked through and lightly charred, 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; coarsely chop. Stir remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro into slaw. Grill tortillas, turning once, 30 seconds per side. To assemble, spoon 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture in center of each tortilla. Divide fish, slaw and avocado among tortillas. Garnish with lime wedges.	9
631	Pappadams (Lentil Wafers)	In North India these legume wafers are called ppapadp and are dry-roasted over a flame, but in the South they are deep-fried until they form lots of air bubbles and become light and puffy. They are sold in many flavors, but plain is preferred in Kerala. Pappadams are always part of a Sadhya: You crush one up and mix it together with rice, dhal, and ghee. The pappadam helps to bind all the ingredients together so you can form balls when eating with your hand. Store-bought wafers are used almost exclusively by Indian cooks because the traditional recipes are labor-intensive and require days of drying in the hot sun. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a wok or 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until a tiny piece of pappadam dropped in oil quickly bobs to surface and expands (about 350F).@newline@Reduce heat to medium-high. Slip 1 pappadam into oil and let it expand to its full size and turn light brown, 10 to 30 seconds. Using tongs, flip it over quickly and fry other side until light brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining pappadams. (If pappadams don't expand immediately, oil is too cool; if they brown too quickly, oil is too hot.)	5
632	Spiced Rum No. 5	Martin Cate, owner of the rum-centric Smuggler's Cove bar in San Francisco, shares his spiced rum recipe below. The secret: Start with good rum, and don't overinfuse the mixture.	Combine 1 bottle (750 milliliters) medium-bodied aged rum (such as El Dorado 5 Year, Mount Gay Eclipse Black, or Appleton Estate V/X), 3 allspice berries, 3 cloves, 1 cardamom pod, 1 segment of a star anise pod, 1/2 cinnamon stick, and 1/8 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg in a lidded 1-quart jar. Twist a 4x1" strip of orange peel (no white pith) just above the mixture to release some of its oils; add peel to jar. Split 1/2 vanilla bean lengthwise; scrape seeds into jar and add bean. Cover jar tightly; shake to combine. Let sit in a dark place for 2 days, shaking once after first day. Strain mixture through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bottle; discard spices. Will keep indefinitely if sealed tightly and stored in a dark, dry place.	7
633	Spinach in Yogurt Sauce	Pachadis are lightly cooked South Indian salads, often involving yogurt. This was my grandmother's recipe, and it remains a feature of my core repertoire because it's so simple and unusual at the same time. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 7 minutes. Add spinach, chile, 2 tablespoons water, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in yogurt.@newline@Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook mustard seeds until they begin to pop and/or turn gray, then add cumin seeds and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until cumin seeds brown, about 30 seconds more. Add curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately for a few seconds, then stir spice mixture into spinach mixture. Season with salt. Serve warm.	1
634	Seasoned Lentil Stew	This aromatic mixture of split peas and vegetables is a staple in the South Indian diet. It always accompanies favorite snacks such as dosas (lentil crpes) and idlis (lentil dumplings). A traditional Sadhya feast wouldn't be complete without this flavorful source of protein. Asafetida (a garlicky resin from the sap of a fennel-like plant; it's often used in lentil dishes) and fenugreek provide its pleasantly pungent aroma. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Bring dal, 1 1/2 cups water, and turmeric to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to very low and cook, covered (check occasionally, and if mixture appears dried out, add up to about 1/4 cup water), until peas are soft and break when pressed with a spoon, about 30 minutes (45 minutes if using split peas).@newline@Meanwhile, dissolve tamarind concentrate in 2 tablespoons hot water, breaking it up with your fingers.@newline@Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook fenugreek seeds and asafetida, stirring, until fenugreek seeds begin to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining 2 cups water, potato, vegetables, chile, cilantro, sambar powder, tamarind mixture, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, until all vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.@newline@Mash dal in saucepan with a potato masher or back of a spoon to form a coarse paste, then stir into vegetable mixture. Simmer 10 minutes, stirring in water as necessary to thin (consistency should be thinner than pea soup). Season with salt and lemon juice.	2
635	Peach Prosecco	Sean Traynor, bartender at The Windsor in Phoenix, Arizona, created this crisp, beautifully hued cocktail for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p Sparkling wine is often used to top off a drink, but in this case Traynor mixes it with the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. The reason? He's using it more for its acidity and flavor than effervescence. For pure peach flavor, Traynor insists on a true peach-based liqueur, so put away the peach Schnapps; he recommends Sathenay Crme de Pche de Vigne Liqueur, Rothman & Winter Orchard Peach Liqueur, or Massenez Crme de Pche.	In a cocktail shaker, combine the vodka, peach liqueur, Prosecco, lemon juice, peach nectar, and bitters, if using. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a chilled champagne coupe and garnish with a peach wedge.	8
636	Classic Salad	We use fresh lemon juice for this vinaigrette as often as we do vinegar.	Using a wooden spoon, mash garlic, anchovy, and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in vinegar, then 1/4 cup oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more oil, if desired. Add lettuce leaves and chives just before serving and toss to coat.	7
637	Parmesan Shortbread with Fennel and Sea Salt	Any salty hard cheese, such as an aged Manchego, Grana Padano, or Mimolette, would be a fine substitute for the Parmesan. This recipe is from Caitlin Williams Freeman's upcoming cookbook, pThe Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee.	Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a medium bowl on low speed until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Add powdered sugar, pepper, and kosher salt. Reduce speed to medium and beat, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until light and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Add flour and cheese. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat mixture just until dough comes together.@newline@Wrap dough in plastic and flatten into a rectangle. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Dough can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before continuing.@newline@Place fennel seeds in a resealable plastic freezer bag. Coarsely crush with a rolling pin or the bottom of a skillet. Alternatively, pulse in a spice mill until coarsely crushed. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in sea salt. Set fennel salt aside.@newline@Arrange a rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove plastic wrap from dough. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10x8" rectangle about 1/4" thick. Cut in thirds crosswise, then cut each third crosswise into 6 rectangles. Arrange cookies on prepared baking sheet, spacing 1" apart. Brush cookies generously with oil, then sprinkle with fennel salt.@newline@Bake, rotating sheet halfway through, until cookies are golden brown (flecks of cheese will be slightly darker), 20-24 minutes. Let cool on sheets for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.	9
638	A Green Peas Soup, without Meat	This Mary Kettilby recipe produces a classic Potage St. Germain. The name comes from the Paris suburb of St.-Germain-en-Laye, where young peas, a rarity in the early eighteenth century, were sown in boxes for early-spring cultivation. The addition of onions and spinach provide a traditional French touch, making this soup a flavorsome beginning for spring menu.p	1. Put 8 cups of the peas and 4 cups of the water in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add the salt, pepper, mace, cloves, thyme, and marjoram, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the peas are very tender.@newline@2. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid in the sauceupan. Puree the peas in a food processor or with a food mill. If using a food mill, discard the skins. Press the puree through a sieve into the reserved liquid, stirring to combine thoroughly. Cover and set aside to keep warm.@newline@3. Combine the remaining 2 cups of peas with the remaining 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the peas are just tender.@newline@4. While the second batch of peas is cooking, melt the butter in a saut pan. Add the green onions, and saut for about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and mint and stir together, cooking until the spinach has just wilted. Blend in the flour, and cook for about 1 minute.@newline@5. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid, and stir the peas into the warm soup along with the spinach mixture. Heat until it begins to simmer, adding the reserved pea-cooking liquida little at a timeif the soup is too thick. Season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.@newline@6. Pour the soup into a tureen, and garnish with diced toast and shredded calendula blossoms, if desired.	9
639	To Make an Excellent Cherry Bounce	Among the few recipes known to have been used by the Washington family is this one for cherry bounce, a brandy-based drink popular in the eighteenth century. It seems to have been such a favorite of General Washington's that he packed a "Canteen" of it, along with Madeira and port, for a trip west across the Allegheny Mountains in September 1784.p	1. Pit the cherries, cut them in half, and put them in a large bowl. Using a potato masher, carefully mash the fruit to extract as much juice as possible. Strain the juice through a large fine-mesh strainer, pressing the fruit with a sturdy spoon. (You should have about 8 cups.) Reserve the mashed cherries in the freezer or refrigerator for later use. If using jarred cherries, drain the fruit and set the juice aside before halving and mashing the cherries. Add any pressed juice to the reserved jarred juice.@newline@2. In a lidded 1-gallon glass jar, combine the juice with the brandy and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover with the lid, and set aside in the refrigerator for 24 hours, occasionally stirring or carefully shaking the jar.@newline@3. Bring 2 cups of the juice to a simmer over medium heat. Taste the sweetened juice and add more sugar, if desired. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, cloves, and nutmeg. Then cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Strain, and discard the spices.@newline@4. Stir the spiced juice back into the 1-gallon glass jar with the reserved sweetened juice. Cover loosely with the lid, and set aside for at least 2 weeks before serving, occasionally shaking the jar with care.@newline@5. Serve at room temperature in small cordial or wine glasses. Store the remaining cherry bounce in the refrigerator.	4
640	Popeye Pie	This pizza is one of my most popular dishes, a kind of warm spinach salad on a crust. I've been serving it since the earliest days at Sullivan Street (its originshow I came to make itare now lost in the mists of memory). But, even today, to the best of my knowledge, I'm the only one who offers it. Try it at home, and right after that first bite, you'll see why it's one of the most popular pies I've ever devised. When I make the Popeye in my home kitchen, I deviate from the usual system in this book and bake it (as called for here) rather than placing it under the broiler. The image of that mound of spinach directly under flame just seems wrongI'm not even sure what would happen, but it wouldn't be good.	1 Place the pizza stone in a gas oven on the middle rack. Preheat the oven on bake at 500F for 30 minutes. Switch to broil for 10 minutes and then back to bake at 500F. (For an electric variation, see Cooks' Note.)@newline@2 With the dough on the peel, sprinkle the surface evenly with the garlic. Distribute the pecorino, Gruyre, and mozzarella evenly over the dough. Sprinkle evenly with pepper.@newline@3 With quick, jerking motions, slide the pie onto the stone. Bake for 2 minutes.@newline@4 Pull the rack partially out of the oven. Quickly add the spinach in what will look like a big mound (the spinach will reduce, the mound flattening, as spinach always does when it cooks). Sprinkle evenly with salt. Return the pie to the oven for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes in a gas oven (somewhat longer with an electric oven; see Cooks' Note), until the crust is charred in spots, but not as deeply as with the other pizzas in this book.@newline@5 Using the peel, transfer the pizza to a tray or serving platter. Drizzle evenly with oil. Slice and serve immediately.	7
641	Roasted Peanut Soup with Honey Whipped Cream	The foundation of this elegant soup? Peanut butter. Make your own by grinding dry-roasted peanuts in a food processor while you roast the garlic. You can use any mild-flavored honey to sweeten the whipped cream garnish, or go Southern with a spoonful of tupelo honey.	Preheat oven to 450F. Slice off and discard the top third from each head of garlic. Place garlic on a sheet of foil. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil; wrap foil tightly around garlic. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until soft and caramelized, about 45 minutes. Let garlic cool slightly, then squeeze cloves into a small bowl, pouring in any oil remaining in foil.@newline@Pulse peanuts in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Transfer 1/4 cup chopped peanuts to a small bowl, then continue pulsing remaining peanuts until a smooth butter forms, about 2 minutes (there will be about 2/3 cup peanut butter).@newline@Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 15 minutes. Add sliced celery, butter, and reserved roasted garlic with oil; cook, stirring frequently, until celery is softened, about 15 minutes. Add chicken broth and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add potato; simmer until potato is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; discard bay leaf.@newline@Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Working in batches, carefully pure soup in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute per batch, adding peanut butter to last batch. Pour through prepared strainer. Whisk in 1/4 cup cream. Season to taste with salt.@newline@Whisk remaining 1/2 cup cream and a pinch of salt in a small bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually whisk in honey and peanut oil; whisk until stiff peaks form.@newline@Divide soup among bowls. Top with a dollop of honey whipped cream. Sprinkle reserved chopped peanuts and celery leaves over.	2
642	Sorghum-Glazed Baby Carrots	Try sorghum syrup in place of honey to make these simple glazed carrots. Lee's preferred brand is Kentucky Pure Cane Sweet Sorghum, available at bourbonbarrelfoods.com.	Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and saut until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Add ginger and sorghum. Cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in orange juice and bourbon. Return to heat; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are fork-tender, 5-7 minutes. Uncover and cook until liquid has been reduced to a syrupy consistency and carrots are nicely glazed, about 6 minutes. Discard ginger. Season to taste with salt and pepper.	3
643	Caraway Pickles	You'll need to start these pickles a day ahead, so plan accordingly.	Place cucumbers in a stainless-steel or heatproof glass container; set aside.@newline@Bring sugar, all remaining ingredients, and 1/2 cup water just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Let cool for 10 minutes.@newline@Pour pickling liquid over cucumbers. Cover and chill overnight or up to 3 days.	9
644	Clam, Chard, and Bacon Pizza	To easily roll out chilled store-bought dough, soften it first on a baking sheet set over a bowl of hot water.	Preheat oven to 500F. Fill a large bowl with boiling water. Place a baking sheet over; dust with flour. Place dough on baking sheet; cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 minutes to soften. Flip dough; cover and let sit 10 minutes longer.@newline@Meanwhile, drain clams, reserving liquid. Cook bacon in a 12" cast-iron skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Add garlic and shallot to drippings in skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in chard and 1/2 cup reserved clam liquid and cook, stirring, until chard is just wilted, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in butter, vinegar, and as many clams as you'd like. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.@newline@Wipe out skillet and heat over medium-high heat until very hot. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12" round. Sprinkle skillet with cornmeal and transfer dough to skillet. Brush top of dough with oil. Cook, shaking pan occasionally and turning pan to avoid hot spots, until bottom of dough is golden and crispy, 6-8 minutes.@newline@Spread chard mixture over dough. Bake until crust is golden and cooked through, 6-8 minutes. Scatter bacon and cheese over; cook just until cheese is melted, 2-3 minutes longer.	9
645	White Sweet Potatoes with Mirin and Honey	Transform sweet potatoes into caramelized beauties by cooking them with rice wine and honey. Serve them alongside roast duck or pork chops.

This dish marries both traditions. Season with a light hand, as the broth will become saltier as it reduces.	Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ham hock and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, garlic, and bay leaves; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in hot sauce and sugar.

659	Bacon-Infused Carolina Fish Muddle	There are two keys to making this rich, smoky stew as good as it can be: Enhance the flavor of the broth with shrimp shells, and gently simmer the shrimp and fish so as not to overcook them. If you want to skip the homemade shrimp stock, substitute 2 cups of fish stock from your fishmonger or 2 cups of bottled clam juice.	Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring constantly, until pink. Add 3 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cook gently until liquid is reduced to 2 cups. Strain stock, discarding shells.

Season with salt and pepper.	7
663	Coconut Southern Comfort Layer Cake	Don't let the good looks of this eight-layer beauty fool you; it's easy to make. Bake 4 cakes (we used 9" round metal cake pans, but disposable ones work fine), then slice each in half. Finish with toasted coconut, a knockout garnish that's also forgiving it'll mask a less-than-perfect frosting job.	For cake: Arrange racks in top and bottom thirds of oven; preheat to 350F. Coat cake pans with nonstick spray; dust with flour. Whisk 2 3/4 cups flour and next 3 ingredients in a medium bowl.

669	Grapefruit Brle	Using a culinary torch is the best way to caramelize the sugar into a candy shell, but you can also make this old-school breakfast treat using your broiler.	Trim 1/4"-1/2" of peel from bottom of each grapefruit half to stabilize the fruit and prevent it from rocking back and forth. Place grapefruit, cut side down, on paper towels to dry for 5 minutes.

674	Pad Thai	There are two categories of entre in Thailand: dishes served with rice, and noodle dishes, which are presented as one-pot meals and often eaten on the go. Rice noodles cook more quickly than wheat pasta and are the perfect neutral vehicle for intense Thai flavors. This Pad Thai is not the dish from the neighborhood take-out joint. "It ain't made with chicken," says Ricker, whose traditional takepleasantly funky with fish sauce and preserved radish and a touch sour from tamarindis meant to be eaten in the evening as a stand-alone dish.

678	Steamed Fish with Lime and Chile	This is the definition of minimalist Thai cooking. The steam not only gently cooks the fish until just tender but also creates an instant, complex sauce from a handful of basic ingredients. Scoring the fish's flesh allows more of the flavor to season the fish and facilitates faster steaming. The fish is cooked on a plate that fits inside the steamer, to catch the juices.	In a clay mortar, lightly pound garlic, cilantro stems, and chiles with a wooden pestle until a coarse paste forms. Add 2 tablespoons lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and pepper; mix with a spoon to combine. (Alternatively, pulse in a mini-processor until a loose paste forms.)

684	Grapefruit "Creamsicle"	This tart sorbet is great on its own as a palate cleanser, but it tastes even better when paired with store-bought vanilla ice cream. Whichever kind of grapefruit you usepink, white, ruby red, or yellowthe hibiscus ensures a lovely deep-pink color. If you don't have an ice cream maker, turn the sorbet into a granita by freezing it in a 9x9x2" metal pan and mashing any big chunks with a fork after 1 hour.

707	S'mores Crpes	I'm not the first to think of this variation on everyone's favorite campfire sweet, but I'm willing to pit mine against anyone else's! This is a win-win s'more because not only does it turn a beloved but messy dessert into something spectacularand easyfor any time of year, but it also frees you from having to fire up the grill to reach chocolate-marshmallow nirvana.p@newline@pEven better, you can secretly feel good knowing you are upping everyone's fiber with 100 percent whole-wheat crpes (you can't say that about graham crackers), yet the crpes are so tender and have such a deliciously nutty flavor that you'd never guess they're actually good for you. The marshmallow filling may be phomemadep or store-bought. Raspberries are optional, but I bet you'll find they add a welcome hit of color and tang.p	Make crpe batter: In a blender, combine all crpe ingredients and pure on low speed until smooth (scrape down sides of blender, if necessary, and blend again until smooth; do not overblend).

A paillard (which means "ribald" or "bawdy" in French) is a boneless slice of meat pounded thin enough and wide enough to practically cover the surface of a large dinner plate. Because they are so thin, paillards grill through in seconds, so they are one of the quickest grilled meals one can imagine. They also look striking, flopping across a plate like an edible doily. In this recipe the lightness of the paillards is reinforced by a spare seaweed and cucumber salad with a Japanese-style vinaigrette.

Add to the bowl with the wakame.@newline@Add the radishes, cilantro, and scallions to the wakame and cucumbers. Add half the rice vinegar mixture and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds. Toss to combine, and refrigerate until serving.@newline@Light a grill for direct high heat, about 500F.@newline@Coat the chicken breast halves with the sesame oil and the remaining 6 tablespoons sesame seeds. Place one of the breast halves on a large sheet of plastic wrap, season it with salt and pepper, top with another sheet of plastic wrap, and pound until uniformly 1/16 inch thick and the approximate diameter of a dinner plate. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining breast halves, using fresh sheets of plastic for each one.@newline@Brush the grill grate and coat liberally with oil. Remove the plastic wrap from one side of 2 of the flattened breasts and place them on the grill so that they are spread out flat. The easiest way to do this is to support it from the plastic-wrapped side with your open hand and flip it onto the grill. Immediately lift off the sheets of plastic wrap. Grill until the chicken looks opaque at the edge, about 30 seconds. Flip with a spatula and grill 15 seconds on the other side. Remove to a platter, cover to keep warm, and repeat with the other 2 chicken breast halves.@newline@Serve each paillard spread out flat on a dinner plate; it should nearly cover the entire serving surface of the plate. Drizzle the remaining rice vinegar mixture over the paillards, and place a large mound of seaweed salad in the center of each one.	10
712	Guinness-Brined BBQ Lamb Steaks	Guinness, the Irish stout, gives the brine for these simple barbecued lamb steaks much of its punch. Like most dark beers, Guinness has a bittersweet molasses flavor, which is great with lamb. But the hidden power of a Guinness brine is its alcohol content (about 4 percent). Alcohol accelerates the absorption of flavorful components directly into the protein structure of meat, yielding a steak that not only retains about 10 percent more moisture, but also is able to deliver a hit of seasoning with every bite. The flavors of chipotle chiles and cumin in the brine are reinforced with a smoky rub and a dark, pungent Guinness BBQ sauce. A word of warning: the sauce burns easily, so only brush it on the meat at the very end of grilling. In fact it is more flavorful served as a table sauce, although the steaks do look nice varnished with glaze.	Combine the Guinness, salt, sugar, water and 2 tablespoons spice rub in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Drop in the lamb steaks, press out the air, and seal. Refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours.@newline@Light a grill for direct medium-high heat, about 425F.@newline@Remove the lamb from the brine and pat dry. Discard the brine. Coat the lamb with the oil and season with the rub. Set aside for 10 minutes.@newline@Brush the grill grate and rub with oil. Grill the steaks for about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (135F on an instant-read thermometer). Baste with a thin layer of the sauce during the last minute of grilling.@newline@Rest the meat for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the steaks with the remaining sauce on the side.	6
713	Baked Camembert with Thyme & Garlic	This recipe is a favorite of mine on a cold winter's night as it always reminds me of times with friends when we would ski and snowboard all day then sit by a log fire and eat and drink all night. If you don't have maple syrup on hand, use a spoonful of honey instead.	Preheat the oven to 400F. Remove the camembert from the box and discard any wax paper packaging. Take a 10-inch square of foil and place in the box. Place the camembert inside.@newline@Pierce the top of the camembert with the tip of a knife and push in the slices of garlic. Sprinkle the thyme leaves over the top and drizzle with the maple syrup. Loosely scrunch the foil up over the cheese. Set aside.@newline@Brush two 12-inch square sheets (the size of your baking sheet) of parchment paper with oil. Line a baking sheet with one of the oiled parchment sheets, oil-side up. Spread the slices of baguette over the sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with crushed sea salt. Place the remaining sheet of parchment, oil-side down, over the bread.@newline@Place in the oven with the camembert and cook both for 10 to 12 minutes until the cheese has risen and the bread is crisp. Open up the foil and dip in the hot baguette for a simple snack. Delicious!	1
714	Ginger & Hoisin Duck with Glass Noodles	Head to a local Chinese supermarket for the ginger in syrup and, while you're there, pick up a package of glass or cellophane noodles to serve this with. Tangy ginger and flavorful hoisin work so well with duck. Make sure you render the duck breasts well when cooking to get that ultimate crispy skin.	Prick the duck skin with a fork. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the duck breasts, skin-side down, and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Spoon off the fat and discard. Turn the duck breast and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand.@newline@Return the pan to the heat. Add the chopped ginger and the syrup and cook over low heat for 1 minute. Increase the heat; add the hoisin and 2 tablespoons of water. Cook for 1 minute. Add the scallions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until the onions have wilted. Reduce the heat to very low to keep the sauce warm.@newline@Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and drop in the glass noodles. Cook for 2 minutes, drain well, and spoon onto warmed serving plates. Slice the duck breast diagonally and arrange over the noodles. Spoon the ginger and hoisin sauce over the top.	3
715	Creamed Peas and Onions	Peas and onions are a classic holiday duo. Relying on frozen ones, along with a quick bchamel, is a smart move on a busy day of cooking.	Bring milk, cloves, and bay leaf to a boil in a small saucepan; reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes to let flavors meld. Strain into a medium bowl; discard solids. Cover milk and keep warm.@newline@Meanwhile, place onions in a large skillet (at least 12"). Add water to half-cover the onions (about 1 cup). Add 1 tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and onions are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Gently transfer onions to a large plate.@newline@Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium heat; add flour and whisk to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan, for 1 minute. Whisk in reserved milk, adding 1/4-cupful at a time. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add peas and onions; stir until heated through. Gently fold in crme frache.	10
716	Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Banana FroYo	NoDescription	In a blender or food processor, blend yogurt cubes and bananas on high, scraping down sides every minute, until mixture holds together, 3 minutes. Add peanut butter; blend on high until mixture is creamy, like soft-serve ice cream. Stir in chips. Serve immediately, sprinkled with cinnamon, if desired.	10
717	Beluga Lentil Caviar on Blini	This appetizer is a total fake-out and a lot of fun to serve. Ellen and Portia absolutely loved these the first time I served them. They both had fond memories attached to caviar, and this recipe brought back those fun times without compromising their vegan diet. Serve these little morsels with a glass of Champagne and share them with some cool friends.	Make the beluga lentil caviar: Rinse the lentils and put them in a small pot with the water. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until the lentils are soft.@newline@Drain the cooked lentils and place them in medium bowl. Add the salt, capers, and caper brine. Mix well and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, and a maximum of 2 days.@newline@Make the vegan sauce: Mix the vegan mayonnaise with the Miso Mayo in a small bowl and refrigerate until needed.@newline@Make the blini: In a medium bowl, combine the flours and baking powder. Whisk the nondairy milk and melted butter into the flour until a batter forms. Allow the batter to rest a few minutes.@newline@Heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add a small dab of butter to the pan or spray it with nonstick cooking spray. To form each blin, pour a little more than a tablespoon of batter into the pan. You can usually cook 4 to 6 blini at a time. Wait until the pancakes begin to show air bubbles all over the tops and the bottoms are brown. Flip the blini over and cook until golden brown.@newline@Using the back of a spoon, spread a small amount of the Vegan Sour "Cream" on each blin, add a teaspoon of the beluga lentil caviar, and top with a pinch of minced chives. Serve immediately.	11
718	Steak Skewers with Scallion Dipping Sauce	Pelaccio flips the kebab script by cubing luxurious cuts of steak and marinating them in coconut milk, garlic, and chiles. Try this with tri-tip, top sirloin cap steak, or rib eye; just make sure a strip of fat is still intact; you'll use it to thread onto the skewers.	For meat and marinade: Pure all ingredients except steak in a blender or a food processor until smooth. Trim strip of fat (sometimes called a fat cap) from meat. Cut fat into 1/4"-1/2" cubes; cut meat into approximately 1" cubes. Place fat and meat in a large bowl. Add marinade and toss to coat; cover and chill overnight.@newline@Remove fat and meat from marinade, brushing off excess. Thread onto skewers, alternating meat with fat, so that pieces are touching but not pressed tightly together (which would slow down cooking). Leave at least 1" of space at the ends of skewers for easy turning. Discard marinade; save excess fat for basting liquid.	3
719	Melon Carpaccio with Lime	Try this refreshing dessert with other firm, ripe fruit, including pineapple, peaches, or plums. Chill any leftover syrup for sweetening iced tea or cocktails.	Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add mint sprigs and chile. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Remove syrup from heat; cover and let steep for 15 minutes for flavors to infuse.@newline@Strain syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; stir in lime juice. DO AHEAD: Syrup can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Arrange melon slices in a 13x9x2" glass baking dish. Pour syrup over melon in baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours to allow flavors to meld.@newline@Divide melon slices among plates, overlapping them decoratively. Pour remaining syrup in dish into a small pitcher. DO AHEAD: Melon carpaccio can be made up to 5 hours ahead. Cover and chill melon and remaining syrup separately.@newline@Drizzle some of syrup over melon. Place a scoop of sorbet in center of each plate, if using; garnish with mint leaves and lime zest.	1
720	Grilled Shrimp with Chile, Cilantro, and Lime	You bought the freshest-looking shrimp, baby squid, or whole fish you could find. Now what? Follow Pelaccio's road map for any kind of seafood: Marinate it in turmeric and fish sauce, grill it quickly over high heat, then pair it with a fiery dipping sauce.	Combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 tablespoons oil, and turmeric in a large bowl; toss to coat. Let stand for 30 minutes.@newline@Pure 4 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 tablespoons oil, cilantro, and remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor until a coarse mixture forms; transfer dipping sauce to a small bowl and set aside.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Oil grill grates. Shake excess liquid from shrimp and place shrimp on grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until shrimp are charred and cooked through, 5-6 minutes.@newline@Serve immediately with sauce.	3
721	Coffee S'mores Pie	This sophisticated mashup of the campfire classic uses Nutella to bind the graham cracker crust and coffee to deepen the chocolate flavor in the rich ganache filling.	For graham cracker crust: Mix graham cracker crumbs and remaining ingredients in a small bowl to blend. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of pie dish; chill until crust is firm, about 30 minutes.	10
722	Mixed Berry Gazpacho with Basil	Michael Laiskonis uses a little sugar and the gentle heat of a double boiler to draw out the berries' juices without cooking them, yielding a vibrant sweet soup.	Combine first 6 ingredients and basil sprig in a medium heatproof bowl; toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Place over a large saucepan of simmering water; cook for 10 minutes.@newline@Let cool for 15 minutes. Chill until cold, about 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Berry gazpacho can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Divide fruit and juices among bowls; drizzle with oil, garnish with basil leaves and pepper, and top with a scoop of ice cream.	1
723	Grilled Turmeric and Lemongrass Chicken Wings	Cooking the wings slowly over medium-low coals and turning them often makes for crisp results; the skin will brown while the meat cooks through. Be sure to begin 1 day ahead; the chicken needs to marinate overnight for the flavors to infuse.	Combine coconut milk, shallots, garlic, lemongrass, jalapeos, ginger, lime juice, tamarind juice, fish sauce, kosher salt, turmeric, and 1 cup water in a blender. Pure mixture until a smooth marinade forms.@newline@Place chicken wings in a large baking dish. Pour marinade over; turn wings to coat evenly. Cover chicken and chill overnight.@newline@Remove chicken from marinade, shaking any excess marinade back into dish. Transfer chicken to a large platter. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.@newline@Transfer marinade to a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until marinade thickens, 10-15 minutes. Pour half of marinade into a small bowl; set aside for basting chicken while it grills. Keep remaining marinade in saucepan; cover and keep warm until ready to serve the chicken.@newline@Build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Oil grill grates to prevent sticking. Grill chicken wings, turning every 5 minutes and basting occasionally with marinade in small bowl, until fat is rendered and skin is nicely charred in spots, 30-35 minutes. (The key here is to turn the wings often so the skin doesn't burn.)@newline@Continue cooking chicken without basting (so it will get crisp) until wings are cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.@newline@Transfer chicken to a large platter and let it rest for 5 minutes. Squeeze lime wedges over wings. Transfer marinade in saucepan to a small bowl. Serve warm marinade alongside chicken as a dipping sauce.	6
724	Cheesecake with Ginger-Lime Candied Raspberries	You may never bake a cheesecake again; Laiskonis sets his super-light filling with gelatin instead of eggs and flavors it with a refreshing hit of citrus.	For shortbread crust: Lightly coat an 8x8x2" baking pan with nonstick spray; line with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang.@newline@Mix crumbs, butter, and salt in a medium bowl until it resembles moist sand. Press evenly onto bottom of pan. Cover; chill.	9
725	Jalapeo Tequila Gimlet	Forget the mezcal. Use this chile-infused tequila in Margaritas and Palomassalt-rimmed cocktails made with tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda.	Grill, broil, or roast jalapeos over a gas flame, turning frequently, until soft and charred. Stem and chop chiles.@newline@Transfer chiles and seeds, if using, to a jar. Add tequila and let sit for 1 hour. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium pitcher; discard solids in sieve. Stir in lime juice, agave syrup, and 2 cups ice (to chill and dilute). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until ice is melted. Divide gimlet among chilled glasses.	6
726	Strawberry-Hibiscus Granita	Want the fluffiest ice? Scrape the frozen mixture with a fork every 30 minutes to create smaller crystals.	Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in hibiscus and basil sprig. Remove from heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Cover and chill hibiscus tea until cold, at least 1 hour.@newline@Meanwhile, blend quartered strawberries in a blender until finely pured. Transfer to a large bowl; add tea, agave syrup, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Season to taste, adding more agave and lime juice, if desired.@newline@Pour strawberry mixture into a 13x9x2" metal pan and freeze until top layer begins to harden, about 2 hours. Using a fork, scrape mixture to break frozen portions into tiny pieces. Freeze for 30 minutes; scrape again. Repeat until granita resembles fluffy shaved ice, about 4 hours.@newline@Divide among bowls. Garnish with basil leaves and diced strawberries.	4
727	Chocolate Semifreddo with Chile-Chocolate Sauce	The keys to a light, airy semifreddo that melts in your mouth? Just enough sugar to sweeten it and keep it soft in the freezer. Also, "gently folding and not overmixing," says Laiskonis. Go over the top by serving it with cinnamon whipped cream and chile-chocolate sauce (or use store- bought chocolate sauce).	For semifreddo: Spray a 9x4 1/2 x 3" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with plastic wrap, leaving a 2" overhang; set aside. Whisk egg whites and sugar in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water until sugar dissolves and egg whites are warm (but not hot), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium-high speed until cool, tripled in volume, and stiff peaks form, about 8 minutes. (If egg whites look grainy, you've gone too far.)@newline@Stir chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl over same saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth; remove from heat; let cool slightly.@newline@Beat cream in another medium bowl until medium-stiff peaks form (cream should be soft and pillowy; peaks will just fall onto themselves). Using a rubber spatula, gently fold egg whites into warm chocolate. Fold in whipped cream. (Stop folding as soon as mixture becomes one smooth texture and light brown color.) Scrape semifreddo into prepared pan; smooth top. Cover tightly and freeze until firm, 3-4 hours. DO AHEAD: Semifreddo can be made 5 days ahead. Keep tightly wrapped and frozen.	9
728	Chicken Under a Brick with Avocados and Chiles	This technique encourages even cooking with the crispiest skin imaginable. The key to success is to cook the chicken over medium-low coals so the skin slowly renders out the fat. As for those grilled avocados, you're in for a treat. They're already our go-to side this summer.	Open chicken and place on a work surface, skin side up. Using your palms, firmly press on breastbone to flatten the breast. Season chicken all over with 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne. Place in a baking dish; rub with 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with lemon zest, and scatter rosemary over. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.@newline@Build a medium-low fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium. Place chicken, skin side down, on grill and place a brick or heavy skillet on top of chicken to weigh it down. (This will expose more skin to direct heat, making it crispy; the chicken will also cook faster.) Cook until skin is crispy and golden brown, about 15 minutes.@newline@Using tongs, set brick aside. Turn chicken, cover grill, and cook for 10 more minutes. Continue cooking and turning chicken every 10 minutes, covering grill between turns, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165F, about 50 minutes total. Transfer to a carving board; let chicken rest for 10-20 minutes. (Resting will make for juicier meat.)@newline@While chicken rests, add more coals to fire if necessary to increase heat to medium, or heat gas grill to medium-high. Season chile, bell pepper, and onion with salt and pepper. Grill (or use a grill basket) over medium heat, turning occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, about 12 minutes. Transfer onion to a medium bowl. Transfer chiles and peppers to a work surface and cut lengthwise into 1" slices. Add to bowl with onion. Add 1/4 cup vinegar to vegetables and toss to coat.@newline@Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add basil and stir to wilt. Add basil mixture to bowl with onion. Season vegetables to taste with salt and more vinegar, if desired.@newline@Rub cut side of avocados with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt, and sprinkle with chili powder. Grill, cut side down, until avocado is gently warmed and flesh is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Serve chicken with vegetables and avocados.	9
729	Apricot Rice Pudding Pops	Thai-flavored rice pudding is frozen into creamy ice pops. Dried apricots add subtle color and a satisfyingly chewy texture.	Combine milk, coconut milk, cream, lemongrass, ginger, and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a boil; remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 15 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, place rice and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl; let stand for 10 minutes (to soften and release some starch). Drain.@newline@Strain coconut-milk mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium saucepan. Add rice; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer (do not stir or rice will become too starchy) until rice is very tender, 30-35 minutes. Let cool slightly.@newline@Stir in apricots and sugar. Divide mixture among ice-pop molds. Freeze until beginning to set, 30-45 minutes. Insert a stick into each pop. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour longer. DO AHEAD: Pops can be made 2 weeks ahead. Keep frozen.	5
730	Grilled Kale Salad with Ricotta and Plums	Quickly grilling kale makes it crispy. Pairing it with fresh plums and ricotta transforms it into our new favorite salad.	Whisk 3 tablespoons oil, vinegar, thyme, and honey in a medium bowl. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Add plums and toss to coat; transfer plums to a plate.@newline@Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush kale leaves with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt. Grill kale, turning once, until crispy and charred at edges, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a work surface; let stand until cool enough to handle. Remove large center stems with a knife and discard (just trim the tough ends from smaller, more tender kale stems).@newline@Divide ricotta among plates; season with salt and pepper. Stir vinaigrette again. Tear larger kale leaves into pieces (leave smaller leaves whole). Place leaves in a large bowl and toss with some of the vinaigrette. Divide leaves among plates. Top with plums and drizzle some vinaigrette over.	5
731	Clinched Double-Wide Loin Lamb Chops	When Pete and I tried this in London, we were amazed. It's probably what made us decide to do a whole chapter in clinching. Lamb that doesn't flare up, leaving a slick black residue, is the Holy Grail of every lamb griller. You can cook these chops quickly, with no flame, to produce a beautiful crust and, on the inside, p pointp (perfect) lamb.p@newline@pFor the most part I avoid clinching with bone-in pieces, but here the bone doesn't affect the cooking at allit's essentially just a way of holding the two loin sections together, which makes for a different presentation from a typical lamb chop. You'll need to get these chops from a specialty butcher.p	Allow the lamb to come to room temperature, approximately 1 hour if straight from the refrigerator.@newline@Prepare a "mature level" coal bed, with a clean thin grate or rack set over it if you like; the fire should be very hot.@newline@Season the lamb chops on both sides with the seasoning blend, then lightly moisten your hands with water and work the seasonings into the meat. Allow to stand for 5 minutes to develop a "meat paste."*@newline@Fan or blow-dry excess ash from the coal fire.@newline@Using an herb brush, brush the chops lightly all over with the butter baste. Put the lamb chops on the grill grate or directly on the coals and cook, without moving them, for 3 minutes. Turn, baste lightly, and cook for 3 minutes, then repeat, basting each time the chops are flipped.@newline@Put the foil-wrapped brick on the grill grate or on the coals to be used as a steady point for the chops, lean the chops up against it, fat side down, and cook for 1 minute, or until the internal temperature registers 120F on an instant-read thermometer.@newline@Meanwhile, pour the dressing board onto a cutting board (or mix it directly on the board). Finely chop the tip of the herb brush and mix the herbs into the dressing.@newline@Transfer the lamb chops to the cutting board and turn in the dressing to coat, then transfer to plates and serve.	9

Brush both sides of chops with glaze (from remaining bowl) and arrange on rack of a broiler pan.@newline@Broil 5 inches from heat, 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare. (Don't hesitate to cut and peek to check on the doneness of the meat.)@newline@Transfer chops to a platter and drizzle with reserved glaze.	7
741	Smoked Salmon Toasts with Malt Vinegar Syrup	The Irish are famous for their smoked salmon, so it's a natural for a St. Patrick's Day party. Of course, you don't have to use Irish smoked salmon for these toasts; any coldsmoked salmon will work well, but if you're feeling flush, you will be treating yourself to salmon that is supersilky in texture with a distinct smokiness that comes from spending time near smoldering hardwoods such as oak and beechwood. If topping your salmon with anything other than a gentle squeeze of lemon seems like heresy, don't knock our tangysweet malt vinegar syrup until you've tried it. You just might get hooked.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Put baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake until pale golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool.@newline@While bread is toasting, boil cider, vinegar, honey, and thyme in a small, nonreactive saucepan until syrupy and reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature.@newline@Spread toasts with crme frache and top with salmon. Drizzle with malt syrup.	1
742	Orzo Salad	Orzo is the Italian word for barley, and the slender, grain-shape of orzo pasta makes for a no-fuss, neatly consumed salad, particularly if you are balancing a plate while perched on the edge of a sofa or standing around the TV watching the Super Bowl. Although the salad makes for a great accompaniment to the pStuffed Sliders Your Way,p your vegetarian friends will thank you for providing them with an option they will really enjoy as their main dish.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Roast pine nuts in a rimmed sheet pan until golden, about 8 minutes.@newline@Cook orzo in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until tender, then drain well in a colander.@newline@Meanwhile, whisk together lemon juice, oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.@newline@Add hot orzo to dressing and toss. Let orzo come to room temperature, stirring occasionally.@newline@Add pine nuts, peppers, mozzarella, arugula, and radicchio and toss well.@newline@Season salad with salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice, if desired.	6
743	Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle	I can imagine Argentinians chuckling when they hear about the recent dulce de leche craze in the States. After all, they have been enjoying this sweet, milky caramel for nearly two hundred years. Relatively new here, and often available in the specialty foods section of the supermarket, dulce de leche can be used in all sorts of ways, but we like to drizzle it on top of what could be considered the moistest, most delicious cake on the planet (I double-dare you to find a better one). The combination has a perfect salty-sweet thing happening that is like a highly addictive sensory overload. I promise, it will have you coming back for more. If it doesn't, perhaps the crumbled brittle that decorates the top will.	1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare a 10-inch round cake pan by greasing it with cooking spray and then lining the bottom with parchment paper.@newline@2. To make the cake, pour the hot coffee into a medium bowl and stir in the cocoa powder until it dissolves. Stir in the brown sugar, followed by the yogurt and the vanilla. Stir thoroughly to ensure that all of the ingredients are incorporated.@newline@3. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until light-yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs and mix for 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed.@newline@4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer running on low speed, mix in a third of the flour mixture and half of the coffee mixture. Scrape down the bowl. Add another third of the flour mixture and all the remaining coffee mixture. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold in the remaining flour mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.@newline@5. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the pan in the oven and bake for 20 more minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Then turn the cake out onto a clean plate, remove the parchment, and turn the cake back over onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely.@newline@6. In a food processor, pulse the brittle pieces 3 to 4 times until the brittle is powdery.@newline@7. Put the cooled cake on a serving dish. In a microwave-safe dish, heat the dulce de leche on high power for 30 seconds, or until it is just liquid. Spoon the dulce de leche over the cake, and then sprinkle the kosher salt over the dulce de leche. Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the ground brittle around the outer edge of the cake as a delicious decoration.	5
744	Golden Colcannon Pie	Colcannon, a classic Irish combination of mashed potatoes with cabbage or kale, is standard winter fare. If that sounds, well, boring, trust us, this version is anything but that. We freshen it up by cooking the potatoes and cabbage separately, then we make it easy to serve for a party by adding an egg and baking it in a pie pan, so that you can cut it into wedges.	Steam cabbage in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, until just tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Remove lid, and when cool enough to handle, finely chop leaves.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@While cabbage is steaming, peel and quarter potatoes. Generously cover potatoes with cold water in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan and add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and briskly simmer, partially covered, until tender, 25 to 30 minutes.@newline@Drain potatoes well and mash in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in cabbage, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste. Cool to warm and stir in egg.@newline@Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Brush pie plate with some of butter. Spread potato mixture evenly in plate and brush with remaining butter.@newline@Bake until golden, about 35 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.	4
745	Farmhouse Cheese and Caraway Soda Bread Puddings	Consider this recipe a double whammy. Not only do you end up with a dreamy, cheesy bread pudding, but you also get the recipe for an excellent loaf of Irish soda bread. The bread is so easy to makethere's no yeast involveddon't be surprised if you find yourself baking a loaf often. It makes excellent toast.p	Make soda bread: Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and caraway in a large bowl. Add buttermilk and butter. Stir just until dough is evenly moistened but still lumpy.@newline@Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and turn dough to coat with flour. Gently knead with floured hands about 8 times to form a soft but slightly less sticky dough.@newline@Form into a domed 6-inch round and put on an ungreased baking sheet. Cut a 1/2-inch-deep "X" across top of each loaf with a sharp knife. Using a small sieve, dust 1 tablespoon of additional flour over loaf.@newline@Bake in middle of oven until golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when tapped, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer loaf to a rack and cool completely.	8
746	Queso Fundido	No offense to salsa, but come on, who doesn't love a gooey, cheesy bean dip, bubbling hot like lava from the broiler? If you're a chile head, you'll probably want to up the number of chiles and leave the seeds in. If your friends are more, ahem, delicate, then stick with one chile and remove the seeds and ribs.	Cook chorizo in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until golden and pieces start to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.@newline@Cook onion, garlic, peppers, and paprika in fat remaining in skillet, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and turn golden, about 8 minutes.@newline@Stir in 1/4 cup water and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and almost all liquid is evaporated, about 3 minutes.@newline@Stir in refried beans and remaining 1/2 cup water and simmer until slightly thickened and mixture is bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and stir in reserved chorizo and half the cheese until melted.@newline@Preheat broiler with rack about 6 inches from heat.@newline@Pour bean mixture into a shallow (2-quart) flameproof crock or baking dish and sprinkle with remaining cheese.@newline@Broil 5 to 7 inches from heat until golden and bubbling, about 3 minutes.@newline@Serve with tortilla chips.	3
747	Old-Fashioned Graham Crackers with Turbinado Sugar	Graham crackers are the embodiment of nostalgia. I'd always been happy with the ones in the red box at the supermarketuntil I tried our homemade ones. The difference in texture is immediately apparent. These cookies are less flaky and crumbly than the store-bought version, and they have a great snappy crunch. We also use a high-quality cinnamon, which has a nice spicy quality.	1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.@newline@2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until the mixture is light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture and 1/4 cup of water. Mix for 30 seconds. Repeat this step once, then add the remaining flour mixture and mix just to combine. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 seconds. Divide the dough in half. Cover one half with plastic wrap and set it aside.@newline@3. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface, put the dough on the parchment, and top with a second sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Chill the dough for about 30 minutes.@newline@4. Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, peel off both sheets of parchment, and put the dough on a cutting board. Using a square cookie cutter, cut out the dough, rerolling the scraps twice. Put the cookies on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each cookie with a pinch of turbinado sugar.@newline@6. Bake, rotating the sheet halfway through, for 20 minutes, or until the cookies are a dark golden color around the edges. Let cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.	9
748	Chopped Salad	Every Super Bowl spread needs a refreshing salad to counterbalance the array of must-have dips, cheesy snacks, and meaty mains. Because the elements of this are all chopped, it's a salad that's easy to toss, easy to serve, and best of all, easy to eat.	Whisk together vinegar, sugar, shallot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl, then add oil in a stream, whisking until combined well.@newline@Toss remaining ingredients with dressing.@newline@Season salad with salt and pepper.	5
749	Red Velvet Whoopie Pies	Move over cupcakes: You've had your time in the limelight but we've moved on. Sweets are far easier to eat when the frosting is between the two thin cake layers, not on top. It all comes down to proportions: whoopie pies exemplify the perfect ratio between cake and frosting.p	Make cake rounds: Preheat oven to 350F with racks in upper and lower third. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.@newline@Beat butter, oil, and sugar with an electric mixer until combined well, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg, vanilla, and vinegar.@newline@Reduce speed to low and alternately mix in flour and buttermilk in batches, beginning and ending with the flour until combined.@newline@Add the red food coloring and mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.@newline@Spoon 2 tablespoon mounds of batter 2-inches apart on lined baking sheets.@newline@Bake, switching positions of baking sheets halfway through baking, until rounds are puffed and set, 8 to 10 minutes.@newline@Slide parchment with rounds onto wire racks to cool completely.	3
750	Fresh Pumpkin Pie with Salty Roasted Pepitas	I love pumpkin pie so much that I've requested it as my birthday "cake" every year since I was about thirteen. I happen to have been born in October, so that helps my choice make some sense. I am also fortunate enough to be married to Dave, whom I refer to as a pie guru. The point is, I've eaten a lot of pumpkin pie, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this is the best pumpkin pie ever. If someone feels otherwise, I am ready for a throwdown, because I can guarantee that their version does not have a grainy cornmeal crust and salty, crunchy pumpkin seeds on top. And without those elements, there's just no match.	1. To make the crust, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse 4 or 5 times, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.@newline@2. In a small bowl, mix together the ice water and egg yolk. Add the egg mixture to the food processor, and pulse until the crumbs begin to climb the side of the bowl and hold their shape when pressed together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using your handsand a little muscleform the dough into a 5-inch-diameter disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour before rolling.@newline@3. Unwrap the dough, and using a rolling pin, roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to form an 11-inch circle. Working quickly and carefully, line a 9-inch pie dish with the dough. With your fingertips, make sure that the edge of the pie is smooth and even. Refrigerate it for 20 minutes.@newline@4. Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@5. Remove the pie dish from the refrigerator. Line the crust with tin foil, making sure to cover the sides, and fill it with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Rotate the dish and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the sides are somewhat firm and hold their shape. Remove the foil and bake for 6 minutes, until the bottom of the crust looks dry and the shell is a very pale golden color. Remove the dish from the oven and let the crust cool. Leave the oven on.@newline@6. To make the pepitas, stir together the pumpkin seeds, salt, and oil in a small bowl. Scatter the seeds onto a small baking sheet and toast in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the seeds are slightly toasted. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pepitas cool.@newline@7. To make the filling, mix together the half-and-half and eggs in a medium bowl. Add the pumpkin puree and mix well. Then add the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves, and mix well. The filling will be very runny. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Sprinkle the pepitas on the filling.@newline@8. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the dish and bake for 20 more minutes, or until the center of the pie jiggles just a bit when you touch the oven rack. Transfer the dish to a wire rack and let the pie cool completely.	10
751	Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum	When I was in Trinidad, Winnie Lee Lum showed me how to make this superb dish, which beautifully demonstrates the convergence of Chinese and Trinidadian cooking traditions. Of course, the taste was extraordinary because Lee Lum only cooks with fresh local shrimp that her husband, Tony, purchases for her. Before cooking, she rinses the shrimp in lime juice, a Trinidadian cooking practice said to remove the "fishy" taste. She prefers the Chinese custom of cooking the shrimp in the shell to protect the shrimp's succulence and flavor. Rather than rice wine, Lee Lum insists on using dark Jamaican-style rum; according to her, white rum is too harsh for cooking. This is one of the easiest dishes to stir-fry, and it is guaranteed to satisfy.	1. Using kitchen shears, cut through the shrimp shells two-thirds of the length down the back of the shrimp. Remove the legs and devein the shrimp, leaving the shells and tails on. In a medium bowl toss the shrimp with the lime juice for a few seconds. Rinse the shrimp, drain, and set on a plate lined with paper towels. With more paper towels pat the shrimp dry. In a small bowl combine the ketchup, rum, soy sauce, and ground white pepper.@newline@2. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in the oil, add the garlic and ginger, then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 10 seconds or until the aromatics are fragrant. Push the aromatics to the sides of the wok, carefully add the shrimp and spread them evenly in one layer in the wok. Cook undisturbed 1 minute, letting the shrimp begin to sear. Sprinkle on the salt and stir-fry 30 seconds or until the shrimp begin to turn orange. Add the tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions and stir-fry 1 minute or until the shrimp have turned almost totally orange. Swirl the ketchup mixture into the wok and stir-fry 1 minute or until the shrimp are just cooked through and the sauce coats the shrimp. Stir in the cilantro.	5
752	Fruit and Nut Pancakes	We love to laze about in our pj's over a big breakfast, but we love it even more if our jeans still zip when we get dressed. That's why we're wild about these yummy yet healthy cakes, created by pSELFp contributing experts stephanie Clarke, R.D., and Willow Jarosh, R.D. These beauts pack whole grains for energy, plus fruit for extra tang. Pass the maple syrup! Lindsey Palmer	In a bowl, combine first 5 ingredients. Mash 1 banana; in another bowl, mix mashed banana with milk, egg and almond extract. Pour liquid ingredients into dry ingredients; stir until smooth. Slice remaining banana and stir into batter; add berries. Warm a skillet over medium heat; coat with cooking spray. Measure 14 cup batter; pour onto skillet. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat until batter is gone.	2
753	Braised Meatballs with Artichokes and Fennel	Meatballs are one comfort food trend among many, all of which seem to have been with us since the nineties for no obvious reason. Maybe we've all gotten so very tired of politics and obstructionists and pundits and sign-wavers and bad times and bank bailouts and... OK, comfort foods aren't going away any time soon. So try this Greek-inspired dish, the flavors based on those from the eastern part of the Mediterranean.	1. Mix the ground meat, egg white, bread crumbs, shallots, oregano, dill, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper in a medium bowl until uniformthat is, until the spices are spread evenly throughout; the bread crumbs, too; and the egg white is no longer visible as a scummy film. Form this mixture into 12 golf balls.@newline@2. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Meanwhile, spread the flour on a plate. Swirl the oil into the pot, then roll half the balls in the flour. Put them in the pot and brown on all sides. (OK, geometry teachers, balls don't have sides. But you know what I mean.) About 7 minutes will do it. Transfer them to a plate and repeat with the remaining balls.@newline@3. Dump the onion, fennel, tomato, and artichokes into the pot. Stir over the heat until the onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes.@newline@4. Pour in the broth; stir in the tomato paste, lemon juice, cinnamon, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper. As the mixture begins to simmer, make sure you scrape up any browned bits in the pot. Then tuck the meatballs into the simmering sauce and pour any juices on their plate over everything. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer slowly for 1 hour.	5
754	Bacon Banana Cookies	Ginger, my mother, never liked a bunch of kids in her house. Even as a young girl, I could feel her angst when too many neighborhood kids were around. Her clever solution was to bake a plate of my favorite Bacon Banana Cookies and leave them on the front porch, locking the door behind her. I never minded being sequestered outside with my food loot in the summer because the porch concrete cooled my skin.p	Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.@newline@In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the salt.@newline@In a medium mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to cream together the butter and 1 cup of the sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until they are fully incorporated. Beat in the vanilla. Add the butter mixture to the flour mixture, then stir in the mashed bananas, beating well after each addition. Fold in the bacon.@newline@Stir together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the remaining cinnamon.@newline@Drop the dough by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheet 1 inch apart. Sprinkle generously with the cinnamon-sugar and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until slightly browned. Allow the cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container. Cookies will keep for 5 to 7 days.	7
755	Berry Scones	As with any pastry, the trick here is to keep the diced butter cold, which makes for light scones, the only sort of scones to have. I like to cut these into triangles, but rounds are lovely, too. My favorite is cranberry scones. The rich red color of the cranberries against the pale golden scones makes me wish they could just sit out on my counter all day long wrapped loosely in a kitchen towel. But once you and your family experience the moist flakiness of these lightly sweet scones, you'll know why they never seem to brighten your kitchen counter for very long.	1. Preheat your oven to 400F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside.@newline@2. Combine the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Transfer a few tablespoons of this dry ingredient mixture to a small bowl and add the frozen berries. Toss to coat the berries and set aside the small bowl.@newline@3. To the large bowl with the dry ingredients, add the diced butter. Cut it in until the butter resembles pea-size chunks covered in flour. You can either use a pastry cutter or two knives and pretend like you're cutting steak with them over and over.@newline@4. Add the milk to the dry ingredient/butter mixture and stir to combine. The dough will come together. Once the dough has come together, add the berries to the dough and gently fold them in until they are evenly distributed throughout. Handling it as little as possible to keep the butter from melting in your hands, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.@newline@5. Cut the dough into 8 triangles. Transfer the triangles to baking sheets lined with parchment paper, a couple of inches apart. Brush with a bit of milk and sprinkle with a tiny bit of sugar, if you like.@newline@6. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the scones are puffed up and slightly brown around the edges. Serve immediately.	8
756	Chocolate Sandwich Cookies	These otherwise simple cookies have a big "wow" factor. They're addictive, but not in the same way as a certain famous chocolate sandwich cookie. Eating an entire sleeve of those cookies makes me feel vaguely ashamed. But baking and then eating a bunch of these, the homemade gluten-free version, makes me feel clever, ingenious even.	1. In a large bowl, mix the butter, shortening, and vanilla until well blended. Add the first 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and stir until the sugar is incorporated completely into the butter mixture. The filling should be thick and stiff. Add more confectioner's sugar, one tablespoon at a time, to reach the desired consistency.@newline@2. Place one-half of the chocolate wafer cookies upside down on a level surface. Divide the filling among the cookies and flatten with wet hands or a spoon. Place the other half of the cookies right side up on top of the filling and press down gently to create sandwich cookies.	4
757	Carolina Rice Pudding Brle	Humble rice pudding gets a serious makeover with the addition of flavorful, fat-grained Carolina Gold rice and a glassy, sugared brle crust.	Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly grease six 6-ounce ramekins and place on a rimmed baking sheet.@newline@In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk to a low simmer over medium heat with the rice, vanilla bean and reserved seeds, and salt. Raise the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and the mixture is thick and creamy, 20 to 25 minutes.@newline@Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla bean. Add the heavy cream and granulated sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves. Cool slightly, then stir in the egg yolks, butter, nutmeg, and cloves until the butter melts.@newline@Divide the pudding evenly between the prepared ramekins and bake for about 20 minutes, until slightly puffed but still soft in the center. Remove from the oven.@newline@Preheat the broiler or prepare a small kitchen torch. Sprinkle each pudding evenly with about 1 tablespoon of the natural cane sugar.@newline@If using a broiler, place under the broiler in the upper third of the oven until the sugar caramelizes, rotating the baking sheet to evenly brown, 1 to 2 minutes. If using a kitchen torch, torch each pudding individually to caramelize the sugar, being careful to keep the torch at the distance recommended by the manufacturer. Serve warm.	10
758	Brown Bag Chicken	For as long as I can remember, my mom has been cooking chicken in oven bags, those oven-safe plastic bags. So when I recently started roasting chicken in a brown paper bag, I felt sort of like I was going back to my roots. It works great because the paper bag traps just enough steam to make the chicken supermoist and tender, while at the same time letting enough steam escape to allow the skin to get golden brown. It always amazes me that the bag doesnt catch on fireso much so that I think of this as half recipe and half magic trick. Just make sure your broiler is turned off and the bag is not touching the top of the oven.	Preheat the oven to 400F.@newline@Rinse the chicken, pat dry, and remove any excess fat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper to taste inside and out. Place the onion and rosemary inside the cavity and rub the outside of the chicken with the paprika.@newline@Lay a standard-size brown paper grocery bag on its side and place the chicken inside, tying the top of the bag closed with kitchen string. Place the bagged chicken on a rimmed baking sheet in the lower third of the oven, so you have plenty of room at the top. Cook for 1 1/2 hours, remove the chicken from the oven, and carefully open the bag to release the steam. Check for doneness by inserting an internal thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh; it should read about 165F and the juices should run clear when the thigh is pierced with the tip of a small knife. Let rest for about 10 minutes before carving. Slice the breasts and cut the wings, legs, and thighs into pieces. Serve warm.	11
759	Curried Plum and Green Bean Stir-Fry	What a plum deal: Certain molecules in purple produce may help fend off Parkinson's disease by preventing the production of disease-causing toxins.	In a small saucepan, bring rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 1/4 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover; simmer until rice is tender and absorbs the water, 30 to 35 minutes. Turn off heat; leave covered. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook scallion whites, chile, ginger, curry, black pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, stirring, 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and green beans; cook, stirring, until beans turn bright green, about 2 minutes. Add plums, bell pepper and coconut milk; cook and stir until colors are bright and sauce is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cashews. Divide plum-green bean mixture among 4 plates. Serve with rice; sprinkle with scallion greens before serving.	8
760	Pasta with Sausage and Red Grapes	Look di-vine! Red grapes contain antioxidants that combat inflammation, a main acne culprit.	Set a large pot of water to boil. In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat, stirring and breaking up, until well browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer sausage to a paper towel. Add oil to skillet; return to medium heat. Cook onion and garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add grapes, broth and pepper flakes; increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until grapes soften or burst and liquid thickens, about 10 minutes. Return sausage to skillet and stir; turn off heat. When water boils, add remaining 1 tablespoon salt and pasta; cook as directed on package. Drain pasta, add to skillet, and turn on heat to high. Cook, stirring, until sausage is hot and pasta is coated with sauce, 30 to 60 seconds. Divide pasta among 4 bowls; sprinkle each with Parmesan and parsley before serving.	2
761	Cherry Chipotle Chili	When it comes to nutrition, cherries don't bomb. They're rich in anthocyanins, which can jump-start your immune system and mop up free radicals.	In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook turkey with salt and pepper, stirring, until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add carrots, onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder. Add tomatoes, cherries, chipotles, bay leaves and 1/2 cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer; cook, stirring once or twice, until chili thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Add beans; cook 2 minutes. Flavor with chipotle sauce to taste. Remove bay leaves. Divide chili among 4 bowls. Top each with 1 tablespoon yogurt and garnish with cilantro, if desired, before serving.	7
762	Pickled Peppers	NoDescription	Cut large chiles into 1/4 inch rings. Pierce small chiles 3-4 times with a skewer. Pack all chiles in a clean 1-quart jar.@newline@Bring vinegar, all remaining ingredients, and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour hot brine over peppers; seal jar. Let cool, then refrigerate. Serve within 1 month.	10
763	Ruben's Cooler No. 2	Damon Boelte was aiming for something simple and accessible when he concocted this extremely refreshing, very British cooler. "Like a traditional Pimm's Cup, this recipe works well with other spirits, including bourbon, rum, and tequila," he says. "You have my permission to experiment." St-Germain liqueur, made from Alpine elderflowers, brings a floral note.	Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange cucumber slices in single layer on prepared sheet. Freeze until solid, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.@newline@Combine gin, liqueur, lemon juice, salt, and 2 cups ice in a large pitcher. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Stir club soda and frozen cucumber slices into pitcher. Fill 12-ounce highball glasses with ice. Pour cocktail into glasses and serve.	5
764	Raspberry Shrub	This puckery, sparkling aperitif is booze-optional.	Stir 3 tablespoons Simple Syrup, 2 tablespoons Raspberry Vinegar, and 1 tablespoon brandy (optional) in a 12-ounce glass. Fill glass halfway with ice. Fill glass with sparkling water or Prosecco. Garnish with a lemon slice and a mint sprig.	8
765	Chile-Thyme Spice Mix	Use this zesty spice mix for sprinkling over the shellfish, corn, and potatoes.	Pulse chiles in a spice grinder until coarsely ground.

771	Lemon Balm Honeysuckle	Cabell Tomlinson, bar director at Frankies 570 Spuntino in New York City, grew up in the South, where, she says, "the summer air was scented with honeysuckle and lemon balm." Those childhood memories, along with a recipe for the classic Bee's Knees cocktail (rum, lime, and honey), inspired this thirst-quencher. It's equally good with lemon vodka (try Charbay Meyer Lemon Vodka) or white rum (we like Flor de Caa Extra Dry 4 Year). Lemon balm is available at many farmers' markets. Better yet, try planting pots of the prolific herb in your backyard.	Stir honey and 6 tablespoons hot water in a large pitcher until honey is dissolved. Stir in vodka and lemon juice.

775	Sidewalker	"I created this pitcher drink for people to sip on their front porch, or for city folks to drink at our sidewalk caf," says Damon Boelte, bar director at Prime Meats in Brooklyn. If you've never had a beer cocktail or, better yet, a cocktail made with drinking vinegars, let this be your introduction to two growing trends in the bar world. Look for Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy, a.k.a. applejack ($23), made by America's oldest family-owned distillery, at better liquor stores.	Stir first 4 ingredients in a large pitcher. Add 1 cup ice. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.@newline@Gently stir in beer and club soda. Fill 12 ounce highball glasses with ice. Divide cocktail among glasses.

779	Cucumber-Aloe Cocktail	"Here's a summer cocktail that isn't too herbaceous or vegetably," Kinch says. "Aloe juice goes well with cucumbers, and Hendrick's Gin adds nice rose and cucumber notes."	Using a muddler or the handle of a wooden spoon, crush and mash cucumber and shiso in a cocktail shaker. Add gin and mash again. Fill shaker halfway with ice cubes. Add tonic, aloe, and Chartreuse. Stir to blend well. Fill 2 Old Fashioned glasses with ice; strain cocktail into glasses.	7
780	Greek Millet Saganaki with Shrimp and Ouzo	A saganaki is a traditional two-handled skillet in which Greeks serve aromatic one-pot dishes, typically topped with cheese. This recipe is a play on the classic shrimp and feta saganaki, to which I have added millet for a deliciously satisfying meal, finished with a dash of ouzo to infuse the shrimp with its distinctive anise flavor. A Dutch oven doubles beautifully as a serving vessel, or transfer the cooked millet to a shallow serving bowl and top the ouzo-infused shrimp.	1 To prepare the millet, bring the water, millet, bay leaf, and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes. Uncover, remove the bay leaf, and set aside to cool.@newline@2 Meanwhile, make the saganaki. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the onion, garlic, chile, and salt; cook, stirring frequently, until the onion softens and turns light golden, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it darkens, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with their juices and the pepper; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to maintain a light boil and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes.@newline@3 Stir in the millet and green olives. Taste for salt and pepper and adjust (keeping in mind that olives and feta cheese can be quite salty). Remove the pot from the heat, sprinkle with the feta, and cover to allow the cheese to soften.@newline@4 To prepare the shrimp, season them with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until it shimmers. Add the shrimp. Cook, undisturbed, until the shrimp turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes, and then flip them with a spatula and cook until they are just opaque throughout, 1 to 2 more minutes, depending on the size. Add the ouzo and cook until syrupy, about 30 seconds. Using a spatula, briskly remove the shrimp from the pan and arrange on top of the millet. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once.	4

784	Amaranth-Walnut Cookies with Brandy	Everyone needs a real butter cookie once in a while. I certainly do. These cookies showcase the intense nuttiness of amaranth flour. Rolling them in minuscule amaranth seeds gives them a playful touch and adds a nice crunch, but they are also delicious without. Fine sea salt retains some of its crystalline texture during baking, adding sparks of salt to contrast the natural sweetness of the whole grain flours.p	1 Place the 4 ounces of walnuts and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until the mixture looks sandy and the nuts are finely ground, about 15 seconds.@newline@2 Whisk together the white whole wheat flour, amaranth flour, and salt in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the remaining sugar and beat until fluffy and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping the sides with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg yolk, brandy, and vanilla and beat until well blended, about 30 seconds. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the nut mixture, then gradually add the flour mixture until it is just incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill until the dough is firm, at least 3 hours or overnight.@newline@3 Place a rack 1 notch below the center of the oven and preheat to 350F. Line 2 large rimless baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the amaranth seeds in a small bowl.@newline@4 Pinch off walnut-size pieces of the firm dough and roll them between your palms into smooth 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in amaranth seeds, gently pressing to adhere if needed, and place on the baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between pieces. Make an indentation with your thumb in the center of each ball, gently pressing it down about a third of its height, and then lightly press a walnut half into the center.@newline@5 Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies just turn golden brown around the edges and firm up but still yield to gentle pressure, 17 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully slide the parchment paper with the cookies onto a wire rack to cool. The cookies will crisp as they cool.	6
785	Spelt Crust Pizza with Fennel, Prosciutto, and Apples	If pizza crust seems daunting and time-consuming to make, try this easy spelt dough, which is moistened with ricotta cheese and aromatic linseed oil. This rustic dinner is stunning to behold  thinly sliced apples and fennel sit on a tangy sour cream layer and are topped with lightly crisped prosciutto. The crust is inspired by classic German dough with Quark, a delicious fresh cheese, which keeps baked goods fresh. While your dough rests, preheat the oven and prepare the toppings  voil, dinner! Great also as a party appetizer in the early fall with a glass of ros or dry white wine, or with a chilled lager in the summer.p	1 First, make the dough. To prepare the dough by hand: Whisk together the spelt flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, milk, linseed oil, and the egg and beat with a fork until smooth. Pour the ricotta mixture into the well. Combine with a dough whisk or a fork, stirring from the center and gradually incorporating the flour from the sides until a fairly moist dough comes together. To prepare the dough by food processor: Place the spelt flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl and process for about 10 seconds. In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, milk, linseed oil, and the egg and beat with a fork until smooth. Pour the ricotta mixture across the top of the flour mixture and pulse, in 1-second intervals, just until a ball forms, 5 to 10 pulses. The dough will be fairly moist.@newline@2 Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Lightly flour your hands and briefly knead 5 to 7 turns to get a smooth yet slightly tacky dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes to allow the bran in the flour to soften.@newline@3 Meanwhile, place a baking stone on a rack on the bottom shelf and preheat oven to 425F. Liberally sprinkle a pizza peel with coarse cornmeal. Finely chop the white and light green parts of the green onions until you have 1/2 cup.

Finely chop the dark green parts as well (about 1/4 cup) and set aside for garnish.@newline@4 Unwrap the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface and cut into 2 pieces. Keep 1 piece covered with plastic wrap. Lightly flour your hands and briefly knead the other until smooth, 7 to 10 turns. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into an elongated pizza, 11 by 8 inches and about 1/4 inch thick. Do this in stages, occasionally turning the dough over and rolling it out further, lightly flouring your work surface and the rolling pin each time. Place the dough on the pizza peel. Spread half of the sour cream topping across, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Cover with half of the apple slices, top with half of the fennel slices, and sprinkle with half of the prosciutto. Brush the border with oil.@newline@5 Slide the dough onto the baking stone and bake until the fennel just starts to brown at the edges and the rim turns golden brown and starts to crisp  it should yield when pressed with a finger  about 15 minutes. Use a large spatula to lift the edges of the pizza so you can slide the peel underneath; carefully transfer the pizza to a wooden board. Sprinkle with half of the reserved green onions and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Cut with a sharp knife and serve at once. Repeat with the second pizza.	8

801	Spicy Seattle Tuna Rolls	The Seattle Mariners serve tuna "Ichirolls" in honor of all-star Ichiro Suzuki.	Pure chiles, ginger, sesame seeds, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mini-processor until paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in both oils and vinegar. Season dressing with salt. Add tuna; gently toss just to coat.@newline@Place nori sheets on a work surface with short side facing you. Spread about 2 rounded tablespoons rice evenly on bottom third of each sheet. Divide tuna mixture among rolls, spooning over rice. Top with fillings. Roll into cones or log shapes, using a few grains of cooked rice as "glue" to seal.	9
802	Dilly Beans	These brined green beans get their snappy flavor from fermentation. Use them to make the pDilly Bean Potato Saladp, serve with charcuterie, or use as a Bloody Mary garnish.	Stir salt and 1 gallon warm water in a large bowl until salt is dissolved. Let brine cool to room temperature.@newline@Layer beans with remaining ingredients in a large ceramic, glass, or stainless-steel mixing bowl. Add brine to cover. Pour remaining brine into a resealable plastic bag; seal and place on beans to submerge. Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Let stand at room temperature until bubbles form around edge of bowl, 4-5 days.@newline@Spoon off any foam from surface of brine. Continue to let stand at room temperature, discarding foam as necessary, until beans are pickled, about 2 weeks.@newline@Using a slotted spoon, divide beans, herbs, and spices among 3 clean 1-quart jars.

803	San Francisco Garlic Fries	Our lighter take on the Gilroy Garlic Fries at the San Francisco Giants' AT&T Park forgoes the deep fryer in favor of a hot oven.	Preheat oven to 450F. Coat a large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Toss potatoes with 2 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer on baking sheet.@newline@Roast the potatoes, turning occasionally, until browned and tender, about 30 minutes. Increase heat to 500F.

Add hot fries, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat.	9
804	Balsamic-Strawberry Pops	A little balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of black pepper bring out the sweetness of ripe strawberries.	Place the strawberries and sugar in a food processor and pulse just until the mixture is finely chopped and juicy but still chunky; you don't want a smooth pure. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of pepper.@newline@Spoon the mixture into ice pop molds and insert sticks. Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 1 week.@newline@To unmold the pops, run hot water over the outsides of the molds for a few seconds, then gently pull the sticks.	1
805	Raspberry-Vanilla Parfait Pops	Because pured frozen raspberries and yogurt both have thick, creamy textures, you can spoon them into pop molds one after the other for a striking layered effect without taking the time to freeze the layers separately.	In a blender, pure the 1 1/2 cups raspberries, the sugar, and 1/2 cup yogurt until smooth and thick.@newline@Divide about half of the raspberry mixture equally among ice pop molds. Divide the remaining 1 cup yogurt among the molds. Slide in the halved raspberries (if using). Follow with the remaining raspberry mixture and insert sticks. Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 1 week.@newline@To unmold the pops, run hot water over the outsides of the molds for a few seconds, then gently pull the sticks.	8
806	Prosecco-Rose Petal Pops	If I were hosting a swanky rooftop engagement party on a hot summer evening, I'd make these refreshing, not-too-sweet ice pops. You'll need to let the Prosecco get flat in the refrigerator before making the pops. If you're in a hurry, decant it into a large bowl, and it will turn flat faster. Be sure to use food-safe rose petals that haven't been sprayed with pesticide.	In a large bowl, stir together the grape juice, Prosecco, rose water, and lemon juice. Fill ice pop molds about one-third full. Drop two or three rose petals into each mold and freeze until set, about 30 minutes.@newline@Fill the molds another third of the way full and drop two or three more rose petals in each mold. Insert sticks. Freeze until set, about 30 minutes. Fill all the way with the remaining Prosecco mixture and drop two or three more rose petals into each mold. Freeze until set, at least 8 hours or up to 1 week.@newline@To unmold the pops, run hot water over the outsides of the molds for a few seconds, then gently pull the sticks.	4
807	Honey Bread	In the land of milk and honey, injera may be the staple, but it is not the only kind of bread. In the morning, it's dabohoney breadthat graces the Ethiopian breakfast table. Unlike the pancakelike injera, dabo is a European-style loaf that is typically slathered with shiro, a chickpea spread. It highlights one of the distinctive characteristics of Ethiopian cooking: sweeteners are very rarely used, but an element of sweetness is introduced through other means, such as sugary coffees and teas; tej, a syrupy honey wine; or this dense breakfast bread, which lends a gentle sweetness to the start of the day.	Toast the rosemary in a small saut pan over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and set aside.@newline@In a small bowl, combine the oil, yeast, and warm water and stir to dissolve the yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy.@newline@Combine the flour and salt and mound in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle. Slowly pour the dissolved yeast into the well, working in the flour with your fingertips, then knead the dough until a ball forms. Knead in the honey and toasted rosemary.@newline@Put the dough in a large oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth or oiled plastic wrap and let rise to 1 1/2 times the original size, about 1 hour.@newline@Grease two 9 x 4-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough and transfer to a floured work surface. Knead for 5 minutes. Divide the dough in half and shape into loaves. Place in the prepared pans, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 20 minutes.@newline@Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the pans in the oven and bake until the tops are golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. Invert the pans onto a cooling rack and let sit for 5 minutes, then remove the pans and let cool.	11
808	Tempeh and Eggplant Pot Pies	Use any combination of vegetables for the filling here. The dough is perfect for making drop biscuits (a recipe found in pThe Joy of Vegan Bakingp) and the topping is perfect for fruit-based cobblers.	Preheat oven to 425F (220C, or gas mark 7). Coat 4 or 6 individual ramekins with oil, and set aside. You also can use a 9-inch (23 cm) square pan or a rectangular pan.@newline@To make filling, steam eggplant and tempeh for 10 to 15 minutes, until eggplant is soft and translucent. At the same time, add water or oil to a large-size saut pan and cook onion and celery until soft. Add fennel seeds, capers, and vinegar, and saut for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, red pepper flakes, and cooked tempeh and eggplant. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.@newline@Meanwhile, prepare biscuit dough. Place flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl, and stir together. Pour in nondairy milk and butter or oil, and mix just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. The dough should be lumpy and sticky, not smooth like cake batter.@newline@Remove saut pan from heat, and season filling with salt and pepper, to taste.@newline@Divide filling evenly among prepared ramekins. Drop dough by small spoonfuls on top of each ramekin. Carefully spread dough with back of spoon so it evenly covers filling. Bake pot pies until crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.	3
809	Morning Sun	Brandi, our fearless juice bar manager, contributed to this recipe, and I love the name. It really does feel like sunshine in a glass and is a great way to start the day.	Run the oranges, apple, pear, pineapple, and ginger through the juicer.@newline@Pour a few tablespoons of the juice into a small bowl and whisk in the honey until completely smooth.@newline@Pour this mixture back into the juice, shake to combine, and pour over ice to serve. Garnish with the orange slices.	4
810	Lemon Pudding Filled Coconut Cupcakes with Shaved Coconut Topping	My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-old's birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-olds birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste tests, was a huge hit with the kids, who are always our toughest fans. Packed with coconut for electrolytes, lemon juice for vitamin C, and bananas for potassium, these little gems keep us feeling great.	To make the pudding, place the cashews in the Personal Blender with the grinder lid and 2-cup container or a food processor and grind into a powder. Add the bananas, lemon juice, and agave syrup and process until smooth. Place in the fridge to chill.@newline@To make the cupcakes, combine the pecans, coconut, and salt in the food processor and process into evenly sized small pieces, taking care not to overprocess into a butter. Scoop the mixture into another bowl. Combine the dates and vanilla in the food processor and process into small pieces. Return the pecan mixture to the food processor and pulse to mix. The cake mix should have a crumbly but sticky texture.@newline@Place 6 cupcake liners in a muffin pan. Use a 1/2-cup measuring cup to scoop 1/2 cup loosely packed pecan mixture into each. Using your fingertips, gently press to firm up the cupcakes and create cavities in the centers to hold the pudding. Make sure the edges reach the tops of the cupcake liners.@newline@To assemble, scoop about 3 tablespoons pudding into each cupcake and top with coconut. Place the muffin pan in the refrigerator to chill for several hours to firm up the cupcakes before serving.@newline@The pudding will keep for a few days in fridge when stored separately. The cupcakes, stored separately, will keep for several weeks in the fridge. The assembled cupcakes will keep in the fridge for a few days.	5
811	Navy Bean Gravy	Most people seem to have a particular way they like their gravy. This one is of the thick, southern-style kinds that you serve on the side and is great for dipping your biscuit or potatoes in. Since everything is pureed, don't be too particular about how you chop the ingredients up. The thyme leaves don't have to be meticulously pulled from the stems; so long as the stems are tender enough to chop them up, toothat way everything comes together fast. An immersion blender comes in really handy here, but if you don't have one, a blender is just fine, too.	Preheat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saut the onion and garlic in the oil for about 5 minutes. Add the thyme and black pepper (I like a lot of black pepper in this) and cook for about 3 minutes more. While that is cooking, stir the flour into the broth until dissolved.@newline@If you have an immersion blender, then add the beans, broth mixture, and soy sauce to the saucepan. Blend immediately and lower the heat to medium. Stir the gravy often for about 10 minutes while it thickens.@newline@If you are using a regular blender, add the beans, broth mixture, and soy sauce to the blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the onion and the other stuff from the pan to the blender. Puree again until no big chunks of onion are left. Add back to the pot and stir often over medium heat to thicken.@newline@Once the gravy thickens, reduce the heat to low. Now you can decide exactly how thick you want it by adding splashes of water, anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Cook for about 20 more minutes to let the flavors deepen, stirring occasionally. Add water as necessary and taste for salt. Keep gravy covered and warm until ready to serve.	4
812	Beet Bundt Cake	*Soy-freep	Preheat oven to 375F (190C, or gas mark 5), and lightly oil a Bundt pan.@newline@In a mixing bowl, cream together oil and brown sugar. Add beets, melted chocolate chips, and vanilla, and mix well.@newline@In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to wet beet mixture, and stir until just combined.@newline@Pour into prepared Bundt pan, and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.@newline@Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Cool completely. Before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar and top with blueberries, if desired.	5
813	Lemon Ice Cream Sandwiches with Blueberry Swirl	Everyone's free to be a kid again with one of these wickedly good frozen treats in hand. Chewy blondie cookies bookend a thick layer of lemony ice cream (store-bought vanilla bumped up with lemon juice and zest) ribboned with a speedy blueberry compote.	Make lemon ice cream: Transfer ice cream to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 30 percent power in 10-second intervals, stirring, until softened, about 50 seconds total (see cooks' note, below).@newline@Stir in lemon zest and juice. Spread ice cream thinly in a 13-by 9-inch baking dish and freeze while making compote and sandwich layers.	4
814	Greek-Style Salad	Radicchio adds streaks of scarlet and a pleasant bitterness to the usual Greek-salad suspects. A simple lemon and olive-oil dressing keeps things light and fresh.	Whisk together lemon juice, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until sugar and salt have dissolved.@newline@Add oil and whisk until combined well. Stir in tomatoes and onion and let stand 10 minutes.@newline@Add remaining ingredients and toss to coat.	2
815	Pork Chops Saltimbocca with Sauted Spinach	Any excuse to cook a pork chop is a good excuse, and here is one of Italian origin: You get to stuff it with prosciutto, not to mention buttery Fontina and aromatic sage.	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Cut a deep, wide pocket in each pork chop. Sprinkle half of sage into each pocket and stuff pockets with cheese and prosciutto. Pat chops dry and season with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total).@newline@Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch ovenproof heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook chops until undersides are golden, about 2 minutes, then turn chops and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until cooked through, about 5 minutes.@newline@While chops cook, heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 5-quart pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Saut garlic until pale golden, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.@newline@Transfer chops to a platter. Add butter and lemon juice to hot skillet, stirring and scraping up brown bits, then pour sauce over pork.@newline@Serve pork with spinach.	12
816	Eggplant, Green Olive, and Provolone Pizza	Good, cheesy pizza generally doesn't need much help in the flavor department, but a grilled pie has a smoky dimension (here amplified by meaty grilled eggplant) that always leaves people clamoring for more.	Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium heat; see Grilling Procedure .@newline@Stir together garlic and oil. Brush some of garlic oil on both sides of eggplant and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Grill, covered, turning once, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes total. Cut into roughly 1-inch pieces.@newline@Stretch dough into about a 12- by 10-inch rectangle on a large baking sheet and lightly brush with garlic oil.

Turn off broiler and leave peaches in oven just until tips of meringue are browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute (watch carefully).	1
820	Chive Shortcakes with Smoky Corn and Okra Stew	Comfort food, August-style: A creamed-vegetable stew tastes mighty fine ladled over pillowy biscuits dotted with chives. A store-bought smoked turkey leg deepens the stew's flavor almost effortlesslyits bone and skin go into making the broth (along with the corn cobs and silk), and its meat is stirred into the stew.	Make Stew: Heat a 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick; preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until hot, then brown ears of corn, in batches if necessary. Cut kernels from cobs and set aside. Put cobs and silk into a medium pot. Remove skin, bone, and tendons from turkey (reserve meat) and add to cobs along with water, 1 onion quarter, and 1 teaspoon salt, then simmer briskly until liquid is reduced to about 3 cups, 30 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through a sieve into a bowl, discarding solids.@newline@Cut turkey meat into 1/2-inch pieces.@newline@Coarsely chop remaining onion, then cook in butter with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in okra and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in corn broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring, then boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.@newline@Stir in corn kernels and turkey, then gently simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.	8
821	Cantaloupe Grappa Semifreddo	A psemifreddop is an Italian soft-frozen custard mousse. Grappa, which is floral and just a little edgy, bumps the musky, intoxicating sweetness of the melon up a notch.	Line loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang at each end. Pure melon with 1/3 cup sugar, grappa, grenadine (if using), and salt in a blender until smooth. Transfer to large metal bowl and stir in yolks. Set bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and beat with mixer until pale, thick, and tripled in volume and registers 170F on an instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes.@newline@Remove bowl from saucepan and set in a large ice bath.

Uncover top and invert semifreddo onto a plate.	7
822	Tangy Frozen Greek Yogurt	Americans have learned to appreciate plain whole-milk "Greek-style" yogurt in all its thick, rich, creamy glory, and those attributes are played up here. Buttermilk and lemon juice bolster its pleasing tartness, and light corn syrup adds body.	Warm sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a large bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.@newline@Whisk in yogurt, buttermilk, and lemon juice and chill until very cold, 3 to 6 hours.@newline@Freeze yogurt in ice cream maker.

823	Oat Crisps with Blueberries and Crme Frache	NoDescription	Preheat the oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@In a bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and corn syrup and stir until blended. Stir in the oats, mixing well.@newline@To form the crisps, drop the oats mixture by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake, rotating the baking sheets 180 degrees at the midway point, until golden brown and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets. Then, using a metal spatula, transfer the crisps to a large flat plate to cool.	5
824	Pierogi (Potato and Mushroom Sauerkraut)	Everyone's favorite Polish dumpling. Toothsome, warm, soft, and smothered in caramelized onionsyep, that's the stuff! In NYC, pierogi are a brunch staple. Our Polish diners are a disappearing breed, but you can live the life in your own kitchen.p	Make the Caramelized Onions Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet, preferably cast iron, over low heat. Add the oil and the onions and toss the onions to coat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, leaving a little gap for steam to escape. Stir occasionally, every 5 minutes or so. Onions should turn amber, but not burn, although a couple of darker spots are fine.@newline@Remove the cover and turn the heat up just a bit, to a medium setting. Stir often for 10 more minutes. Onions should become a darker amber, and some of the moisture should evaporate.	7
825	Blueberry Muffins with Lemon Blackberry Glaze	These muffins arelike blueberry biscuits served in a cupcake cup. They're moist, delicious, and look pretty with violet-colored glaze. Full of omega-3s and 6s, antioxidants, and vitamins, they're great in the morning with a cup of tea, juice, or smoothie.

826	Garlic-Oregano Grilled Pita Bread	Pita rounds spring to life after just a couple of minutes on a hot grill: The dimpled surfaces of the flatbread crisp up in a nice contrast with their soft interiors (be sure to buy the pocketless kind of pita, which is fluffier than pita that is meant to be split and stuffed). A shake of crunchy kosher salt and a brush of garlicky olive oil flecked with oregano knocks them out of the park.	Heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook garlic, turning once, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Discard garlic and remove skillet from heat, then stir in oregano.@newline@Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure .@newline@Oil grill rack. Grill pitas, 3 at a time, covered only if using a gas grill, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes total per batch. Transfer to a cutting board and brush both sides with garlic-oregano oil. Cut pitas into wedges. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Serve warm.	4
827	Smoke-Baked Barbecue Chile Pie	Smoke baking is a great technique to use for garlic bread, pizzas, quiche, or a savory breakfast casserolewhenever you want to bake and get a hit of smoky flavor at the same time. You can smoke bake using a charcoal grill, gas grill, or a traditional smoker with a smoking temperature you can control (water smokers have a set temperature of 225F to 250F and will not work for this recipe). When chiles from Hatch, New Mexico, come to market in August, I stock up on enough to roast and freeze for chile pies, pots of Southwestern chili, and batches of salsa through the winter months. You can substitute other varieties of chiles (or bell peppers for a less spicy result) in this recipe and experiment with additional ingredients, such as a garnish of chopped scallions, cilantro, or parsley. A teaspoon of your favorite chili seasoning blend or barbecue dry rub could add a special accent. If you can't get Hatch chile peppers, no problem. Buy fresh green Anaheim peppers and fire roast them at home. For a true Southwestern flavor use the heavier mesquite woodvery sparingly hereor pecan. This is a great dish for a light supper or an outdoor brunch.p	1. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to high.@newline@2. Line the bottom and sides of the pie crust with the chile pepper strips, reserving a few to garnish the top of the pie. Top with the cheese, spreading it out evenly over the bottom of the crust.@newline@3. In a small saut pan over medium heat, saut the onions in the olive oil until softened, about 3 minutes. In a medium-size bowl, combine the eggs and onion, then pour the mixture over the cheese. Arrange the reserved chile pepper strips on the top of the pie.@newline@4. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the drained wood chips on the hot coals, or put the dry wood chips in a metal container and place closest to a burner on a gas grill. Place the pie on the indirect side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.@newline@5. Smoke bake the pie at 350F for 40 to 45 minutes or until the crust has browned, the filling has set, and the pie has a mild, smoky aroma. Sprinkle with the bacon before serving.	9
828	Butt in a Bag	This variation on the traditional method has never failed me. I learned it at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue event more than two decades ago from an Arkansas cook. It's simple. Place a partially smoked pork butt in a paper grocery bag and finish cooking by slow smoking it. The paper absorbs some of the grease and keeps the meat from drying out. People ask me, "Won't the bag catch on fire?" The bag will be saturated with pork fat, but a bag fire hasn't happened to me yet. For true Southern pork butt, go with hickory wood. However, I like to use fruitwoodmaybe even peach or cherrymixed with pecan. Because pork butt slow smokes for 6 hours, this is not a recipe to try on a gas grill.p	1. Mix the pepper and salt together and rub it on all surfaces of the pork. Set aside while you build the fire.@newline@2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. Oil the grill grate.@newline@3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals. Place the butt on the indirect side of the grill across from the coals. Increase the temperature to 350F by opening the bottom vents on your grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid. Place a candy thermometer in the lid vent. Smoke for 30 to 45 minutes to get the bark started.@newline@4. Reduce the temperature by closing the vents until you're at 225F to 250F. Smoke the pork for 4 hours. Place the butt in a brown paper grocery bag large enough to hold it, fold the ends over to close it, and return it to the same place in the smoker, opposite the fire. Add more briquets if necessary, and close the lid. Continue smoking for 2 to 4 more hours or until tender. Check for tenderness by pulling a piece of meat off and tasting it. The mark of a shoulder done to perfection is when you can remove the blade bone by pulling it out with your hand.@newline@5. When the shoulder is done, set it aside in a pan to rest for 30 minutes, then move it to a cutting board. Serve it Southern-style pulled (stringy portions torn off by hand), Kansas City-style thick sliced, or the-hell-with-it chopped. Some barbecuers like to mix in a little tangy barbecue sauce as they're chopping and combining the meat on a platter, especially if the pork is still a little fatty.	2
829	Tomato and Corn Pie	What's integral here is a very thin biscuit crust instead of one made of pastry dough. The inspiration is twofold: the tomato pie brought to us in August 1992 by the late novelist and food writer Laurie Colwin and James Beard's recipe for a quiche-like tomato cheese pie, which appeared in his American Cookery (1972). It's fun to imagine inviting the pair of them for lunch and serving this, along with a crunchy green salad and a big, beautiful glass pitcher of iced tea.	Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl, then blend in cold butter (3/4 stick) with your fingertips or a pastry blender until it resembles coarse meal. Add milk, stirring until mixture just forms a dough, then gather into a ball.@newline@Divide dough in half and roll out 1 piece between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into a 12-inch round (1/8 inch thick). Remove top sheet of plastic wrap, then lift dough using bottom sheet of plastic wrap and invert into pie plate, patting with your fingers to fit (trim any overhang).

830	Spicy Adobo Shrimp Cocktail	Shrimp cocktail quickly becomes much more than a classic first course when you give it some Latin flair. Try tossing lime juice, cilantro, piquant padobop sauce, and creamy avocado into the mix.	Cook shrimp in lightly salted boiling water until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes, then drain. Chill until cold, about 10 minutes.@newline@Gently stir together remaining ingredients with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then stir in shrimp.	3
831	Cool Jade Soup	The inspiration for test kitchen director Ruth Cousineaus velvety chilled bean soup comes from Mediterranean-cooking authority Claudia Roden's recipe for pbissarap, an Egyptian bean-and-herb pure. The beans here are lima and green, simmered in chicken broth (you can use vegetable broth if you want to go vegetarian) and then pured until silky. The herbsparsley, cilantro, dill, and mintare blended with olive oil so that you can finish the soup with a verdant drizzle, but dont think of the herb oil as merely a garnish: Its bright flavor brings everything together.	Simmer lima and green beans, water, broth, scallions, cumin, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan over medium heat, covered, until beans are tender, about 15 minutes. Pure mixture in batches in a blender until very smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Force pure through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Chill (covered once cool) until cold, about 1 hour.@newline@While soup chills, pure herbs with oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in cleaned blender.@newline@Season soup with salt and pepper.

833	Baked Tomatoes with Hazelnut Bread Crumbs	A topping of buttery whole-wheat bread crumbs and hazelnuts creates a toasty counterpoint to baked thick-sliced tomatoes. What prevents it from being too rich, though, is the accent of thymelemon thyme in particular. With its small green leaves edged in yellow, the herb is easy to spot at the farmers market. Still not sure? Take a sniff. Lemon thyme's brisk, citrusy scent is a real eye-opener.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter a 2-quart shallow ceramic or glass baking dish.@newline@Spread bread crumbs in a 4-sided sheet pan and toast in oven until dried and pale golden, about 15 minutes. Cool crumbs.

Freeze until scoopable, about 4 hours, depending on your freezer.	5
839	Smoked Stuffed Chile Poppers	Chile "poppers"just pop 'em in your mouthare on many restaurant menus, and they're easy to prepare in your own backyard. They need to smoke at a higher temperature so the bacon wrapped around the outside of the chile gets cooked through. Although higher-heat smoking is technically not considered low-and-slow traditional barbecue, it does have its place in recipes like this one (and for people who use a ceramic smoker, which automatically smokes at a higher temperature). At a lower temperature, the bacon won't crisp up. You can also use this technique to smoke other bacon-wrapped appetizers like shrimp, water chestnuts, or green bean bundles. If you like, substitute goat cheese, garlic-and-herb cream cheese, or even pimiento cheese spread for the cream cheese and cheddar. You can also use almonds or walnuts instead of the pecans, or omit the nuts.p@newline@pThese poppers are so addictive that you can make a meal out of them! They are slightly fiery, but even friends who describe themselves as heat-intolerant have devoured these and raved about them. Jalapeos of any size will do, but the bigger ones hold more flavor and are easier to fill with cheese. I use a swivel-blade potato peeler or a paring knife to core the peppers. And remember to wear disposable food-handing gloves when touching fresh jalapeos, because oil from hot chiles will stick to your heands. If you rub your eyes or other sensitive areas after working with the chiles, it can be painful. If the chiles are mild, however, gloves aren't necessary.p@newline@pYou can buy metal chile popper racks, but you can also use cardboard egg carton. At 350F, the carton won't burn and you can simply throw it away when you're done. Another big plus to using an egg carton is that the carton absorbs bacon fat. This means no grease flare-ups. You can enhance the hickory or maple wood smoke flavor in the bacon by using that type of wood for your fire, or you can add a little different flavor to your poppers by using apple, oak, or pecan.p	1. To make the popper filling, combine the cheeses in a medium-size bowl and stir them together with a fork. Put the cheese mixture in a gallon-size zipper-top plastic bag and cut a small hole in one corner of the bag. Squeeze each jalapeo full of the cheese mixture. Place the cheese-filled jalapeos in the egg carton. Push a pecan half into each pepper. Wrap a half strip of bacon around each jalapeo and secure with a toothpick.@newline@2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to high.@newline@3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the drained wood chips on the hot coals, or put the dry wood chips in a metal container and place closest to a burner on a gas grill. Place the jalapeos on the indirect side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.@newline@4. Smoke the peppers at 350F for 1 hour and 15 minutes until the bacon is cooked and the jalapeo have a smoky aroma.	11
840	Pimiento Cheeseburgers	Even folks in the South, where pimiento cheese is lovingly called the "pt of the South," will give you a quizzical look when you mention this burger. I always thought its true home was around Columbia, South Carolina, and the lower upstate area. But then I saw a pimiento cheeseburger on the menu in a wonderful burger joint and restaurant called Litton's, in Knoxville, Tennessee, so I guess a good idea can cross state lines. So here's how to do it, complete with a little pimiento cheese recipe, but the burger's not bad even if you have to use a good-quality store-bought pimiento cheese.	1. In a medium bowl, mix together the onion, both cheeses, mayonnaise, and pimientos. If you need additional mayonnaise to make it creamy, add a little bit at a time. Grind copious amounts of black pepper and stir that into the cheese mixture.@newline@2. Divide the ground beef into 6 equal portions and shape into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Remember to put a slight indentation into the center of each patty. Season both sides of the burgers liberally with salt and pepper.@newline@3. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes.@newline@4. Place the burgers on the grill and lower the heat to medium. Grill for about 5 minutes. Turn the patties and continue grilling until they reach your desired doneness, about 4 additional minutes for medium, 6 minutes for medium-well. During the last 2 minutes of cooking time, add the buns, cut side down. At the last minute before taking the hamburgers off the grill, put a generous spoonful of pimiento cheese on each. Take the buns from the grill, place on a platter, set a burger on each bun bottom, add pickled jalapeos on top of the pimiento cheese, and serve.	5
841	Fattoush	Coating the toasted pita in olive oil prevents it from getting soggy when mixed with the vegetables and dressing.

860	Rich Chocolate Cake with Salty Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut Brittle	I can imagine Argentinians chuckling when they hear about the recent dulce de leche craze in the States. After all, they have been enjoying this sweet, milky caramel for nearly two hundred years. Relatively new here, and often available in the specialty foods section of the supermarket, dulce de leche can be used in all sorts of ways, but we like to drizzle it on top of what could be considered the moistest, most delicious cake on the planet (I double-dare you to find a better one). The combination has a perfect salty-sweet thing happening that is like a highly addictive sensory overload. I promise, it will have you coming back for more. If it doesn't, perhaps the crumbled brittle that decorates the top will.	1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare a 10-inch round cake pan by greasing it with cooking spray and then lining the bottom with parchment paper.@newline@2. To make the cake, pour the hot coffee into a medium bowl and stir in the cocoa powder until it dissolves. Stir in the brown sugar, followed by the yogurt and the vanilla. Stir thoroughly to ensure that all of the ingredients are incorporated.@newline@3. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until light-yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs and mix for 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed.@newline@4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer running on low speed, mix in a third of the flour mixture and half of the coffee mixture. Scrape down the bowl. Add another third of the flour mixture and all the remaining coffee mixture. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold in the remaining flour mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.@newline@5. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the pan in the oven and bake for 20 more minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Then turn the cake out onto a clean plate, remove the parchment, and turn the cake back over onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely.@newline@6. In a food processor, pulse the brittle pieces 3 to 4 times until the brittle is powdery.@newline@7. Put the cooled cake on a serving dish. In a microwave-safe dish, heat the dulce de leche on high power for 30 seconds, or until it is just liquid. Spoon the dulce de leche over the cake, and then sprinkle the kosher salt over the dulce de leche. Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the ground brittle around the outer edge of the cake as a delicious decoration.	8
861	Golden Colcannon Pie	Colcannon, a classic Irish combination of mashed potatoes with cabbage or kale, is standard winter fare. If that sounds, well, boring, trust us, this version is anything but that. We freshen it up by cooking the potatoes and cabbage separately, then we make it easy to serve for a party by adding an egg and baking it in a pie pan, so that you can cut it into wedges.	Steam cabbage in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, until just tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Remove lid, and when cool enough to handle, finely chop leaves.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@While cabbage is steaming, peel and quarter potatoes. Generously cover potatoes with cold water in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan and add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and briskly simmer, partially covered, until tender, 25 to 30 minutes.@newline@Drain potatoes well and mash in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in cabbage, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste. Cool to warm and stir in egg.@newline@Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Brush pie plate with some of butter.

862	Farmhouse Cheese and Caraway Soda Bread Puddings	Consider this recipe a double whammy. Not only do you end up with a dreamy, cheesy bread pudding, but you also get the recipe for an excellent loaf of Irish soda bread. The bread is so easy to makethere's no yeast involveddon't be surprised if you find yourself baking a loaf often. It makes excellent toast.p	Make soda bread: Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and caraway in a large bowl. Add buttermilk and butter. Stir just until dough is evenly moistened but still lumpy.@newline@Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and turn dough to coat with flour. Gently knead with floured hands about 8 times to form a soft but slightly less sticky dough.@newline@Form into a domed 6-inch round and put on an ungreased baking sheet.

863	Guinness-Glazed Lamb Chops	There's no reason why you can't have your Guinness two ways at once: Enjoy as the day's beverage of choice, and while devouring one of our favorite nuggets of meatlamb rib chopswhich we bathe in an intriguing glaze made from the very same stout cooked down with coriander and black peppercorns. Be sure to look at the Cooks' Notes for more information about Guinness, the spices and the lamb chops.	Bring stout, sugar, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a 2-quart nonreactive saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then continue boiling (keep an eye on it and reduce heat to keep it from boiling over) until glaze is syrupy and reduced to about 1/2 cup, 20 to 30 minutes.@newline@Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and discard solids.@newline@Preheat broiler.@newline@Pat chops dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.@newline@Divide glaze between 2 small bowls and set 1 aside for use later. Brush both sides of chops with glaze (from remaining bowl) and arrange on rack of a broiler pan.@newline@Broil 5 inches from heat, 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare. (Don't hesitate to cut and peek to check on the doneness of the meat.)@newline@Transfer chops to a platter and drizzle with reserved glaze.	2
864	Smoked Salmon Toasts with Malt Vinegar Syrup	The Irish are famous for their smoked salmon, so it's a natural for a St. Patrick's Day party. Of course, you don't have to use Irish smoked salmon for these toasts; any coldsmoked salmon will work well, but if you're feeling flush, you will be treating yourself to salmon that is supersilky in texture with a distinct smokiness that comes from spending time near smoldering hardwoods such as oak and beechwood. If topping your salmon with anything other than a gentle squeeze of lemon seems like heresy, don't knock our tangysweet malt vinegar syrup until you've tried it. You just might get hooked.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Put baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake until pale golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool.@newline@While bread is toasting, boil cider, vinegar, honey, and thyme in a small, nonreactive saucepan until syrupy and reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature.@newline@Spread toasts with crme frache and top with salmon. Drizzle with malt syrup.	11
865	Queso Fundido	No offense to salsa, but come on, who doesn't love a gooey, cheesy bean dip, bubbling hot like lava from the broiler? If you're a chile head, you'll probably want to up the number of chiles and leave the seeds in. If your friends are more, ahem, delicate, then stick with one chile and remove the seeds and ribs.	Cook chorizo in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until golden and pieces start to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.@newline@Cook onion, garlic, peppers, and paprika in fat remaining in skillet, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and turn golden, about 8 minutes.@newline@Stir in 1/4 cup water and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and almost all liquid is evaporated, about 3 minutes.@newline@Stir in refried beans and remaining 1/2 cup water and simmer until slightly thickened and mixture is bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and stir in reserved chorizo and half the cheese until melted.@newline@Preheat broiler with rack about 6 inches from heat.@newline@Pour bean mixture into a shallow (2-quart) flameproof crock or baking dish and sprinkle with remaining cheese.@newline@Broil 5 to 7 inches from heat until golden and bubbling, about 3 minutes.@newline@Serve with tortilla chips.	11
866	Orzo Salad	Orzo is the Italian word for barley, and the slender, grain-shape of orzo pasta makes for a no-fuss, neatly consumed salad, particularly if you are balancing a plate while perched on the edge of a sofa or standing around the TV watching the Super Bowl. Although the salad makes for a great accompaniment to the pStuffed Sliders Your Way,p your vegetarian friends will thank you for providing them with an option they will really enjoy as their main dish.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Roast pine nuts in a rimmed sheet pan until golden, about 8 minutes.@newline@Cook orzo in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until tender, then drain well in a colander.@newline@Meanwhile, whisk together lemon juice, oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.@newline@Add hot orzo to dressing and toss.

867	Old-Fashioned Graham Crackers with Turbinado Sugar	Graham crackers are the embodiment of nostalgia. I'd always been happy with the ones in the red box at the supermarketuntil I tried our homemade ones. The difference in texture is immediately apparent. These cookies are less flaky and crumbly than the store-bought version, and they have a great snappy crunch. We also use a high-quality cinnamon, which has a nice spicy quality.	1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.@newline@2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until the mixture is light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture and 1/4 cup of water. Mix for 30 seconds. Repeat this step once, then add the remaining flour mixture and mix just to combine. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 seconds. Divide the dough in half. Cover one half with plastic wrap and set it aside.@newline@3. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface, put the dough on the parchment, and top with a second sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Chill the dough for about 30 minutes.@newline@4. Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, peel off both sheets of parchment, and put the dough on a cutting board. Using a square cookie cutter, cut out the dough, rerolling the scraps twice. Put the cookies on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each cookie with a pinch of turbinado sugar.@newline@6. Bake, rotating the sheet halfway through, for 20 minutes, or until the cookies are a dark golden color around the edges. Let cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.	12
868	Chopped Salad	Every Super Bowl spread needs a refreshing salad to counterbalance the array of must-have dips, cheesy snacks, and meaty mains. Because the elements of this are all chopped, it's a salad that's easy to toss, easy to serve, and best of all, easy to eat.	Whisk together vinegar, sugar, shallot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl, then add oil in a stream, whisking until combined well.@newline@Toss remaining ingredients with dressing.@newline@Season salad with salt and pepper.	10
869	Red Velvet Whoopie Pies	Move over cupcakes: You've had your time in the limelight but we've moved on. Sweets are far easier to eat when the frosting is between the two thin cake layers, not on top. It all comes down to proportions: whoopie pies exemplify the perfect ratio between cake and frosting.p	Make cake rounds: Preheat oven to 350F with racks in upper and lower third. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.@newline@Beat butter, oil, and sugar with an electric mixer until combined well, about 2 minutes.

870	Fresh Pumpkin Pie with Salty Roasted Pepitas	I love pumpkin pie so much that I've requested it as my birthday "cake" every year since I was about thirteen. I happen to have been born in October, so that helps my choice make some sense. I am also fortunate enough to be married to Dave, whom I refer to as a pie guru. The point is, I've eaten a lot of pumpkin pie, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this is the best pumpkin pie ever. If someone feels otherwise, I am ready for a throwdown, because I can guarantee that their version does not have a grainy cornmeal crust and salty, crunchy pumpkin seeds on top. And without those elements, there's just no match.	1. To make the crust, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse 4 or 5 times, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.@newline@2. In a small bowl, mix together the ice water and egg yolk. Add the egg mixture to the food processor, and pulse until the crumbs begin to climb the side of the bowl and hold their shape when pressed together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using your handsand a little muscleform the dough into a 5-inch-diameter disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour before rolling.@newline@3. Unwrap the dough, and using a rolling pin, roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to form an 11-inch circle. Working quickly and carefully, line a 9-inch pie dish with the dough. With your fingertips, make sure that the edge of the pie is smooth and even. Refrigerate it for 20 minutes.@newline@4. Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@5. Remove the pie dish from the refrigerator. Line the crust with tin foil, making sure to cover the sides, and fill it with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Rotate the dish and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the sides are somewhat firm and hold their shape. Remove the foil and bake for 6 minutes, until the bottom of the crust looks dry and the shell is a very pale golden color. Remove the dish from the oven and let the crust cool. Leave the oven on.@newline@6. To make the pepitas, stir together the pumpkin seeds, salt, and oil in a small bowl. Scatter the seeds onto a small baking sheet and toast in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the seeds are slightly toasted. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pepitas cool.@newline@7. To make the filling, mix together the half-and-half and eggs in a medium bowl. Add the pumpkin puree and mix well. Then add the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves, and mix well. The filling will be very runny. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Sprinkle the pepitas on the filling.@newline@8. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the dish and bake for 20 more minutes, or until the center of the pie jiggles just a bit when you touch the oven rack. Transfer the dish to a wire rack and let the pie cool completely.	9
871	Braised Duck Legs and Sauted Duck Breast	We love how Carena uses every part of the duck: The carcass makes a velvety broth for braising the wings and legs until they're fall- off-the-bone tender; the breast is seared and sprinkled with minced parsley and garlic, so the dish really runs the gamut from deeply meaty to fresh and vibrant.	Cut off legs, wings, and breasts from duck and cut up carcass and wing tips for stock. Remove any bones from breasts, leaving skin on.

922	Jasmin's Pad Thai	Jasmin is a piece of work. Her single-word name only enhances her celebrity status. She's the chef/proprietor of her eponymous quintessential beach hut restaurant on the northern tip of Koh Phi Phi in Thailand. A tall, sexy native with long jet black hair and flowing silk dresses, she's as sharp as a razor blade and intimidating as hell. If you ask her a question, she stops, squints her eyes dubiously, and raises an eyebrow. She's the Queen Bee here. Her worker bees are the little barefoot gypsy kids who live on the beach, the happiest kids I've ever seen. They take her orders, serve her food, and assist her in effortlessly knocking out the freshest and most delicious Thai dishes aroundher clientele buzzes in from every surrounding island. "Just bring us whatever you'd like" (I try to skip the questions). I'll kick back with a Singha and watch those iconic longtail boats pull up with ice crates of screamingly fresh local fish, and I'm eating perfectly executed delicacies fifteen minutes later. Here's a woman who is truly about abundance, joie de vivre, and a spirit so vibrant that it inspires everyone. A true domestic goddess. She graciously taught me this classic in her (outdoor) kitchen on the beach.	Get your mise completely ready to go, because this dish only takes about 5 minutes to cook.@newline@In a wok (of course you can use a frying pan, but it's just not the same; even those cheap stainless steel ones work better than a pan), fry the red onion in a little peanut or olive oil. Add the shrimp (or calamari, chicken, or pork). Cook for a minute. They'll continue so don't worry too much if they're still slightly opaque, and move them over to the side. Make a well in the center. Crack the egg in there and scramble with a fork till cooked. Push over to the side along with the shrimp.@newline@Break the noodles in half (unless your wok is the huge industrial size), and add to the center with about 1/4 cup of the stock, the  sh sauce, tamarind sauce, palm sugar (dissolve it in a little hot water if too thick), and red chile akes. Mix well into the noodles, leaving the shrimp and scrambled egg off to the side.@newline@Cook the noodles in the sauce for a few minutes, stirring lightly to ensure that they don't clump together. The noodles should be just softenedyou want them nice and chewy. Taste and adjust the seasoningand add more stock if necessary.@newline@Now add the bean sprouts and the scallions, stir everything together, and heat it through. Immediately turn onto large plate and top with the chopped cashews. Garnish with lime and cucumber slices.@newline@You now just need a pair of chopsticks and an ice cold Singha.	4
923	Marbleized Eggs	These pretty swirled patterns are made by passing an egg through a bath of enamel paint suspended in water. The process is easy and the pleasantly unpredictable results are always a surprise.	1. Decide the color or combinations you want to useyou may use one or more colors of paint for each marbling bath.@newline@2. For each bath, fill a roasting pan with about 4 inches of water. Put on the rubber gloves. Add about 1 teaspoon of each color paint in the chosen combination. Swirl the end of a skewer through the paint.@newline@3. Place an egg on the end of a skewer. Swirl it around through the paint and water. When the paint has adhered to the egg in a marbled pattern, remove the egg from the skewer to an egg carton and let it dry.@newline@4. Repeat this process for each egg, using the different color marbleizing baths as you wish.@newline@5. To dispose of paint responsibly, pour each bath slowly through a coffee filter, letting the water drain down the sink and capturing the paint. Throw away the paint.	5

Slide the eggs onto skewer on a Styrofoam drying rack (see tip, below). Dip the paintbrush in the food coloring, hold it in one hand above the egg and run your thumb along the bristles or tap the handle to create a spray of paint. Revolve each egg to splatter the entire surface. Allow the eggs to dry for several hours.@newline@2. Seal the hole in the wider end of each blown egg with a small piece of masking tape. Using the pliers, gently chip away the shell around the other hole, enlarging it to the size of a pea. Place the eggs in an egg carton, open-end up.@newline@3. One at a time, fill the eggs with chocolate: Place 1 cup of the baking chips in a food storage bag and twist the bag like a pastry bag to secure the chips in one bottom corner. Microwave on medium for 1 minute, until soft. Snip the corner from the bag and pipe the chocolate into the egg, tapping the egg periodically to compress any air bubbles and filling it completely, to the top of the hole.@newline@4. Refrigerate the eggs overnight so the chocolate is firm. Remove the masking tape. Store in the refrigerator if not eating soon.@newline@5. Tap the eggs on the table to crack the shells, and peel. Yum.	4

Use the paintbrush to cover the entire surface of the egg with blue paint. Insert the skewer into the block of Styrofoam (see tip, below) and allow the paint to dry completelythis usually takes about 5 minutes.@newline@2. Spatter the egg: In separate containers, dilute the brown and white paints with water. If you wish, cover your worktable with newspaper. Arrange the egg on the skewer in the Styrofoam. Dip the paintbrush in the brown paint, hold it in one hand above the egg and run your thumb along the bristles or tap the handle to create a spray of paint. Revolve the egg to splatter the entire surface. Let the paint dry completely, then repeat the process with the white paint. Let the paint dry completely.@newline@3. Cut out the transfer letters so you can apply them individually.@newline@4. One at a time and working very gently, apply each letter to the egg, rub over the acetate with a crafts stick or side of a pencil tip to transfer the design, and then discard the acetate.@newline@5. Place the egg in the nest and tuck a few feathers around it.	11

I am amused when guests comment how light the cream isthis is pure sleight of hand, as the ingredients are extremely rich. If you are serving this, skip the cheese course.@newline@The aim is to whip the white ingredients into a smooth homogenous cream. Process the mascarpone, cream cheese and sugar, then briefly whiz in the other ingredients, scraping down sides of the processor.@newline@Line the molds with wet muslin or cheesecloth, leaving enough to fold over the top so they are completely enclosed, and place them in a rimmed dish or tray.

953	Quick Kimchi	No Korean meal is complete without kimchi, a piquant condiment of fermented vegetables (most popularly cabbage) seasoned with ginger, garlic, chile, and all manner of fresh or preserved seafood. Fermenting the ingredients over several days gives the dish its distinctive tang, but this easy version, which takes advantage of the funky depth of Asian fish sauce, offers relatively instant gratification.

954	Flatbread with Shrimp and White Bean Hummus	At his restaurant, Ford's Filling Station, in Culver City, California, Ben Ford says he strives to serve "things that you don't necessarily identify with traditional comfort food but that give all the [same] nourishment." This signature recipe for flatbreada very thin "pizza" with sweet shrimp, white bean hummus, melted leeks, caramelized onions, and a scattering of sharp cheeseis comforting and satisfying yet anything but bland or conventional.	Make flatbread: In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, stir together water, yeast, and sugar until dissolved, about 5 seconds. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. In large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add to yeast mixture and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Add oil and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Switch to dough hook and mix on medium speed until dough is elastic and pulls away from sides, about 8 minutes. (Dough should feel firm and moist, but not sticky.)@newline@Lightly oil large bowl. Gently shape dough into ball and transfer to bowl. Turn over several times to coat lightly with oil, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place (80F to 85F, see Chef's Notes) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.@newline@While dough is rising, position rack near bottom of oven and top with pizza stone or heavy baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450F for 1 hour.@newline@Set smooth rollers of pasta machine on widest setting (see Chef's Notes). Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Cover 5 parts with plastic wrap.

957	Mandarin Orange Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle	In Korea, dessert often means a simple piece of fruit. This ice cream, though more complex, rings so clearly of mandarin oranges that we think an exception may be made. Sesame seeds, valued in Korean cooking for their medicinal properties, thread their way through the frozen custard as nuggets of honey-sweetened brittle. When making a large amount of ice cream, as this recipe does, it's imperative to churn the mixture in two batches, so ice crystals dont form.	Make custard: Bring cream, juice, and a pinch of salt to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.@newline@Whisk together yolks, sugar, and honey, then add half of cream mixture in a slow stream, whisking constantly.

961	Short Rib and Vegetable Stew	"Koreans are short rib masters," says Chou, who lived and cooked in Korea for several years. "It's their favorite cut." While some ribs are sliced thin, marinated, and grilled, others are reserved for stews and soups. pKalbi jjimp, one of the countrys best-known concoctions, shares some ingredients with a European beef stewnamely, carrots, onions, and potatoesbut here the brothy, slightly sweet dish gets its robust undertones from dried mushrooms, soy sauce, fish sauce, and molasses, plus a dollop of hot red-pepper paste. Though it is rustic-looking, the meat's tenderness and the broths amazing depth make clear why this dish is a national treasure.	Cover short ribs with cold water and soak, chilled, at least 2 hours.@newline@Drain ribs and transfer to an 8-to 10-quart heavy pot with cold water (8 cups).

963	Cucumber Apple Pickle	Korean tablesboth in restaurants and at homeare always set with a series of pbanchanp, or little dishes that can be eaten alone, with rice, or as an accompaniment to the main course. To keep things lively, pbanchanp should run the gamut of tastes and textures, and this particular pickle really sparkles: It is sweet, tart, crisp, and fresh.

979	Cheesy Polenta Lasagne with Mushrooms and Seitan	Increasingly available in supermarkets, the firm wheat protein known as seitan is mild in flavor and versatile in the kitchen. In this casserole, it takes on the earthy flavor of mushrooms, adding heartiness and heft.	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in upper third. Lightly butter a 2-to 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.	5
980	Thai-Style Chicken Soup with Basil	Its hard to understand why a soup that looks so simple needs to include so many ingredients. Why not just stir in a dollop of store-bought Thai curry paste instead and call it a day? One spoonful will reveal the answer: This soup has many layers in its complexity, but the overall effect is of cleanness and freshnessin short, well worth a trip to an Asian market. Adding a generous amount of chicken and serving the soup over jasmine rice might not be strictly traditional, but it transforms it into a satisfying meal.	Cut off and discard top of lemongrass, leaving 6-inch stalks, then finely chop. Cook lemongrass, shallots, and garlic in oil in a large heavy pot over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.@newline@Add stock, reserved tomato juice, tamarind, fish sauce, chiles, lime leaves, and ginger and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.@newline@While soup simmers, freeze chicken breast just until slightly firm, 20 to 30 minutes, then thinly slice crosswise.@newline@Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. Return to a simmer and stir in chicken, diced tomatoes, snow peas, and basil. Gently simmer just until chicken is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with additional fish sauce and salt.	5
981	Apricot Almond Linzertorte	For dessert, Grimes was inspired by something from Vienna, a little farther along the Danube: linzertorte. It's traditionally made with hazelnuts and raspberry jam, but this version, with its warmly spiced almond pastry and vivid apricot filling, spoke to Grimes of the highly polished coffeehouses in that part of the world. Cooking dried apricots with brandy and sugar allows you to control the sweetness quotient, and the result is all about the magically musky, tangy fruit.	Make pastry: Pulse toasted almonds and sugar in a food processor until nuts are finely ground. Sift together flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves into a bowl, then add to ground nuts in processor and pulse to combine.@newline@Lightly beat yolks, extracts, and zest in a small bowl with a fork. Add to food processor along with butter, then pulse until dough forms a ball. Form one third of dough into a disk, then roll out between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into a 10-inch round. Transfer to a baking sheet and chill until firm, about 10 minutes. Roll out remaining dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into a 12-inch round, then transfer to another baking sheet and chill until firm, about 10 minutes.	6
982	Duck Breast with Frise Salad and Port Vinaigrette	Crisp-skinned duck breast really pops with the nutty, buttery flavor of tawny Port. Any leftover meat makes a terrific sandwich.	Put a small shallow flameproof roasting pan in middle of oven and preheat oven to 400F.@newline@Pat duck dry and trim off any fat from sides. Score duck skin in a crosshatch pattern at 1/2-inch intervals with a sharp knife, then season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.@newline@Heat a heavy medium skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot, then cook duck, skin side down, until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to roasting pan and roast in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center registers 135F, 10 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to at least 142F.)@newline@Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from roasting pan, then add oil and shallot and cook over medium heat, stirring, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add Port, then return to heat (Port may ignite) and cook, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute.@newline@Remove from heat and stir in mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Add frise, tossing to combine, and sprinkle with almonds. Serve duck with salad.	7
983	Tunisian Soup with Chard and Egg Noodles	The North African hot sauce called pharissap lends this soup its beautiful brick-red color, as well as a deep, spicy warmth that isnt the least bit aggressive. For a supper thats both robust and rejuvenating, chard, chickpeas, and noodles go into the pot, too.	Toast cumin in a dry small heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat, stirring, until deeply fragrant and dark brown (be careful not to burn). Cool, then grind to a powder in grinder.@newline@Cook chard stems, onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin and salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 12 minutes.

984	Coconut-Crusted Mahimahi with Pan-Roasted Garlic, Rosemary, and Tomato Sauce	In this simple, fresh-tasting dish, a crisp coconut coating keeps the fish moist and gives it real island flair. Chef Roxanne Russell grates and dries her own fresh coconut to get long, beautiful strands, but any grated dried coconut will do.	Marinate fish: Mix 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and marinate fish in it while making sauce.	8
985	Butterscotch Pudding	NoDescription	Whisk together brown sugar, cornstarch, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a heavy medium saucepan, then whisk in milk and cream. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking frequently, then boil, whisking, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and vanilla. Pour into a bowl, then cover surface with buttered wax paper and chill until cold, at least 1 1/2 hours.	4
986	Paprika Veal Shanks	Tender veal shanks get great depth of flavor from plecsp, a kind of Hungarian psofritop of sauted onions, frying peppers, and tomatoes, to which paprika and, in this case, stock are added. (Grimes found that Cubanelle peppers are the best substitute for the long, yellowish-green peppers found throughout Hungary.) Finished with sour cream, the sauce yields more than you need, but you'll be happy to have leftovers to serve over noodles, chicken, or pork.	Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then cook onions and peppers in 1/4 cup oil with bay leaves and 1 teaspoon salt over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice, breaking them up with a spoon, and cook, stirring, until liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle paprika over tomato mixture and stir just to combine, then immediately stir in broth. Remove from heat.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Pat shanks dry and season all over with 2 teaspoon salt. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers, then add 4 shanks and brown, turning once, about 8 minutes total. Add shanks to tomato mixture in roasting pan. Pour off fat from skillet and wipe clean. Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil and brown remaining 4 shanks in same manner, transferring to roasting pan. Pour off fat from skillet, then add wine to skillet and boil, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, 15 to 20 seconds. Pour into roasting pan. Bring to a boil, then cover tightly with heavy-duty foil and braise in oven until very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours (depending on size).@newline@Transfer shanks with a slotted spoon to a platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Skim off any fat from braising liquid.@newline@Whisk together sour cream and flour in a medium bowl. Whisk about 1 cup hot braising liquid into sour-cream mixture, then add mixture to remaining braising liquid in roasting pan and simmer (straddled across 2 burners) over low heat, whisking occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.@newline@Return shanks to sauce along with any meat juices from platter, and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves.	8
987	Tortilla Soup with Chiles and Tomatoes	Tortilla soup is all about contrasting textures, but its real success hinges on a fabulous brothin this case, homemade chicken stock enriched with a cooked pure of chiles, tomatoes, onion, and garlic.

Stir in remaining 7 1/2 cups stock, epazote, and 1 teaspoon salt, then simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes.@newline@While soup simmers, heat 1 inch oil to 350F in a deep 10-inch heavy skillet, then fry tortilla squares, a handful at a time, until golden, 30 to 45 seconds per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season lightly with salt.@newline@Divide tortillas and avocado among soup bowls and ladle in soup. Sprinkle with cheese, drizzle with crema , and top with crumbled chile.	5
988	Parmesan Pull-Aparts	These rolls have a lot in common with briocheboth are rich and tender, and they bake up with a gorgeous browned crust. However, these are much easier to make than that time-intensive bread, and they have the added advantage of aromatic Parmigiano-Reggiano. We guarantee theyll fly out of the bread basket.	Stir together yeast, honey, and 1/3 cup warm milk in mixer bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.) Whisk together flour (2 1/2 cups), cheese, and salt, then mix into yeast mixture along with remaining 1/3 cup warm milk at low speed. Increase speed to medium and beat in 2 eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat, scraping down side of bowl occasionally, until a very soft dough forms, about 3 minutes. Beat in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is elastic, about 2 minutes. (Dough will be very sticky.)@newline@Scrape dough into center of bowl and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoon flour. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.@newline@Punch down dough (do not knead) and turn out onto a floured surface. Cut dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a ball by cupping your hand and pushing dough against work surface as you roll in a circular motion. Arrange rolls 1 inch apart in a buttered 9- by 2-inch round cake pan and cover with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled and dough fills pan, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Whisk together remaining egg with water and brush on tops of rolls. (You will have leftover egg wash.) Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Loosen edges of rolls from pan with a sharp knife and invert rolls onto a rack, then reinvert and cool at least 20 minutes.	11
989	Orange Pumpkin Cloverleafs	Classic shape plus not-so-classic flavors gives these rolls an element of surprise. Thats not to say the wintry blend of pumpkin and orange is overpowering; its actually very subtle, so the rolls go with just about anything you put on the dinner table. Leftovers would be awfully good slathered with butter and toasted for breakfast.	Butter muffin cups with 1 tablespoon melted butter.@newline@Stir together yeast, warm milk, and honey in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.)@newline@Mix flour, salt, pumpkin, 1 whole egg, yolk, orange zest and juice, and remaining 5 tablespoon butter into yeast mixture with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until a soft dough forms. Turn out dough onto a floured surface and knead, dusting surface and your hands with just enough flour to keep dough from sticking, until dough is elastic and smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Form dough into a ball.@newline@Put dough in an oiled large bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.@newline@Punch down dough (do not knead), then halve. Roll half of dough on a lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands into a 12-inch-long log (keep remaining half covered with plastic wrap).@newline@Cut log into 6 equal pieces, then cut each piece into thirds. Roll each piece into a 1-inch ball by cupping your hand and pushing dough against work surface as you roll in a circular motion. Put 3 balls side by side in each of 6 muffin cups.@newline@Make more rolls with remaining dough in same manner.

991	Key Lime Meringue Cake	In the winter months, there's nothing like the bewitching, slightly exotic flavor of Key limes or the larger regular limes (a.k.a. Persian) to transport you mentally to some warm tropical spot, preferably an island with an endless beach. This cake, with its tart lime filling offset by billowy drifts of sweet, marshmallow-like frosting, should do the trick.p	For Cake: Heat oven to 350F. with rack in middle. Butter cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of parchment. Dust pans with additional flour, knocking out excess.@newline@Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl.@newline@Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer (or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

At low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches alternately with milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and mixing until batter is just smooth.@newline@Divide batter between cake pans, spreading it evenly. Bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean and cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans, 20 to 25 minutes.@newline@Cool for 15 minutes in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around sides of pans, invert cake layers onto racks, and cool completely.	6
992	Haroseth (Dried Fruit and Nut Paste)	Haroseth, a symbolic seder food, alludes to the mortar that the Jews used to build the pyramids when enslaved by the Egyptian pharaoh. Though haroseth visually mimes the unappealing look of cement, its taste is actually a delicious combination of fresh or dried fruit, nuts, spices and wine. There are as many variations of haroseth as there are seder tables around the world, and all reflect a myriad of traditions. This recipe is inspired by my grandmother's simple grated apple, walnut, and cinnamon version, along with the flavors of my husband's Middle Eastern background.	Pulse toasted nuts in a food processor until coarsely chopped.@newline@Add dried fruit, zest, and spices and pulse again until chopped.@newline@Add Port and pulse until all ingredients are chopped and combined into a coarse paste.@newline@Transfer to a bowl and stir in raisins.	9
993	Asparagus Green Onion Saut	Passover falls at the cusp of spring, and fresh asparagus on the table is one of the best ways to usher in the new season. Combined with the snap of green beans and sauted with the silky, mild bite of green onions, it becomes a welcome pop of color and texture to the plate.	Bring a 5- to 6-quart pot of water seasoned with 1 tablespoon kosher salt to a boil. Cook asparagus and string beans until just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain, then transfer in a single layer to paper or kitchen towels to dry.@newline@Separate white parts from green parts of scallions. Halve whites lengthwise. Halve green parts lengthwise and again in half crosswise. You should have approximately 3-inch pieces.@newline@Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until oil shimmers. Add white parts of scallions and saut until they just begin to wilt and turn golden, about 2 minutes.@newline@Add asparagus, green beans, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and saut to heat through, 1 minute. Add green parts of scallions and continue to saut until they just begin to wilt, about 1 minute more. Adjust seasoning if necessary and serve with a fresh grind of black pepper.	11
994	Parmesan Pistachio Crisps	These delicious bites couldn't be easier to make, and an added bonus is that they keep well, too. You can buy good quality, already grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or make your own in the food processor (cut the cheese into smaller chunks), but don't even think of getting one of those green canisters!	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Place silpat on a large baking sheet, or if not using a silpat or nonstick baking sheet, line a large baking sheet with parchment. Put rounded teaspoons of cheese 2 inches apart on baking sheets and spread each into a 1 1/2 inch circle.@newline@Sprinkle each round lightly with chopped pistachios (about 1/8 teaspoon for each) and bake until just golden, 6 to 8 minutes.@newline@Let crisps cool on sheet 1 minute then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Bake more crisps in same manner on cooled sheet, wiping nonstick or silpat in between batches (if using), or replacing parchment with each new batch.	8
995	Piquant Bell Peppers	A colorful mix of bell peppers gets a bang of flavor from red wine vinegar, tempered by a touch of sugar and salt. These quick-fix peppers require no roasting and peeling. Just simply slice them up and saut. Serve these alongside our Easter menu's pork loin roast for a bright contrast of flavors that stand up to the hearty main dish.	Cut peppers lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick strips.@newline@Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat and add peppers and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until wilted, 10 to 15 minutes.@newline@Add vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until peppers are tender and most of liquid has evaporated leaving an emulsified sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.	7
996	Salsa Borracha	"Drunken" salsas have been around forever. They were originally prepared with ppulque,p an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of the once-sacred maguey (agave) plant. Pulque, which is not easy to find outside of Mexico, is not distilled and has a much stronger flavor than tequila, which I use in its place in this recipe. The alcohol is mostly burned off in the cooking process, leaving only its musky flavor. The sweetness from the freshly squeezed orange juice gives this salsa a wonderful balance.	Cook the chiles in a dry saut pan over high heat, turning them constantly, for 2 minutes, or until slightly toasted. Halve and seed the chiles. Tear them into small pieces and transfer the pieces to a blender.@newline@Add the orange juice, tequila, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the blender. Puree until the salsa is nearly smooth.@newline@Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saut pan over high heat. Add the salsa and cook for 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

Increase to medium-high and beat for 5 more minutes. Beat on the highest setting for 1 to 2 minutes more. The finished marshmallow will be tripled in volume. Pour it into the prepared pan, using an offset spatula to smooth it into the corners. Sift coating generously over top. Let it set for 6 hours in a cool, dry place.@newline@Use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Invert the slab onto a coating-dusted work surface and dust it with more coating. Cut into shapes and dip the sticky edges in Pop Rocks or more coating, patting off the excess.	7
999	Rigatoni with Roasted Broccoli and Chickpeas	Umami-rich cheese and chicken stock make an encore appearance, but this time they share the spotlight with high-fiber chickpeas. Adding 1/2 cup of these lean beans to your daily diet can help you cut your consumption of fatty foods, a study in the journal pAppetitep notes	Heat oven to 450F. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, saut anchovies with oil and garlic until anchovies dissolve and garlic browns. Add chickpea liquid and bouillon to anchovies; cook, stirring, until bouillon dissolves. Pour anchovy mixture into roasting pan; add chickpeas and broccoli; stir to coat. Roast 20 minutes.

1004	Spaghetti with Turkey Meatballs	Tomatoes are a top plant source of umami, and the riper they are, the better: The fruit's umami components increase during maturation. What's more, whole-wheat pasta has triple the fiber of regular pasta for more fill-you-up power.	Heat oven to 400F. In a large baking dish, combine tomatoes, onion, 1/4 cup oil, garlic, pepper flakes (if desired) and 1 tablespoon salt; cover; roast 45 minutes. Remove dish from oven; mash mixture to break down tomatoes. Cook, uncovered, until sauce is thick and reduced, 45 minutes.

1008	Lan Pham's Herbed-Roasted Onions	Lan Pham was 2 years old when she immigrated to the United States from Vietnam with her family. Her father became a State Department official assigned to various posts in Asia and Africa and she lived in the Philippines during an earthquake and during a political uprising that closed her school. During civil unrest in Ethiopia, U.S. Marines escorted her to class. Yearly monsoons punctuated the relative calm of her high school years in Thailand. When she serves these herb-roasted allium, she tells her guests: "to taste, just one taste, and they are surprised by the sweet flavor and rich aroma. I tell them everybody knows that slow-cooked onions don't give bad breath."	1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Cut each onion into quarters, keeping the root end still intact so wedges hold together.@newline@2. In a large bowl, combine the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil.@newline@3. Add the onions to the bowl and mix well. Transfer the onions to a baking dish or sheet in a single layer.

1009	Annie Lau's Garlic Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts	Annie Lau is ethnically Chinese, born in Malaysia. Her husband is ethnically Chinese, and born in Hawaii. The couple moved to San Jose in the late 1990s and their kitchen is a laboratory where their regional and ethnic influences meet local ingredients. Neither had seen to Brussels sprouts before moving to California, but after numerous attempts, they devised a recipe to bring out the nutty sweetness in the little cabbages. The final recipe, Ms. Lau says, "is an experiment in laziness. The less you do, the better." Try to pick similar size sprouts.	1. Heat the olive oil in nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and light brown. Add the Brussels sprouts and turn heat to medium-high. Season with salt and pepper.@newline@2. Do not disturb for about a minute, so the edges caramelize, then toss. Leave for another minute or more. If the sprouts have not picked up enough golden color toss again. The more caramelization (browning) you get, the better the flavor (high heat is key!). Be careful not to overcook, though, as that releases that nasty sulfur odor that puts people off Brussels sprouts.@newline@3. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.	7

Plus, it will be much easier to cut through the almonds and get nice, neat rounds.	Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg and vanilla. At low speed, mix in flour mixture until a dough just forms.

1107	Cassata Cake	I grew up outside Cleveland, Ohio, and the cassata is the cake of my childhood. This regional specialty is a great example of how recipes take on local styles over time. Some food historians believe the cassata has its roots in fourteenth-century Arab culture. In Sicily, the long-ago homeland of the immigrants who first brought it to America, the cassata often contains candied citrus fruits, citrus liqueurs, and a glazing of chocolate or almond marzipan.p	1. To make the filling, quickly whisk together 4 tablespoons of the milk with the flour. The slurry will be somewhat thick, so whisk thoroughly to make it smooth. Press out any lumps with a flexible spatula, if necessary.@newline@2. Whisk in the rest of the milk and transfer the mixture to a 2-quart heavy-bottom saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Once bubbles that burp steam form, remove the pot from the heat and continue to stir for another 30 seconds.@newline@3. Cover the milk mixture with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Cool for 15 to 30 minutes.@newline@4. Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, citrus oil, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed for up to 5 minutes.@newline@5. Add the milk mixture and continue to beat on high speed until the filling is smooth, another 5 minutes. Beat in the ricotta cheese 1 tablespoon at a time.@newline@6. Preheat the oven to 335F and place the rack in the middle position. Line the bottoms of three 9-by-2- inch round pans with parchment.@newline@7. Measure the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into one bowl, and the milk and vanilla into a separate bowl. Whisk each to combine.@newline@8. In the standing mixer fitted with the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed to a stiff peak. Drizzle in 1 cup of the sugar while the mixer is running. Scoop the meringue into a large bowl and set aside.@newline@9. Lightly wipe the mixer bowl and replace the wire whip with the paddle attachment. Cream the butter with the remaining 1 cup of sugar on low speed.@newline@10. Add the egg yolks one at a time. Scrape the sides of the bowl all the way to the bottom using a flexible spatula and mix on low speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.@newline@11. Alternately add the dry and wet ingredients about a quarter at a time without pausing between additions.@newline@12. Stop the mixer and gently fold the meringue into the batter with a flexible spatula. Pour the mixture evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 27 to 30 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.@newline@13. Cool the cakes for 2 minutes, then run an offset spatula around the edges and invert the cakes onto a flat surface. They will be very fragile, so handle them with care.@newline@14. Assemble the extravagant cake by adding about 1 cup each of the fresh strawberries and the ricotta filling between the layers. Cover the outside of the cake with the whipped cream. Add more fresh strawberries around the edge of the cake if you like.	4
1108	Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake	I spent some time in Knoxville and got to know firsthand how pleasant the people are and how proud they are to maintain the tradition of the apple stack cake. Everyone knows it, and the routine that they follow to make and serve it is serious business.p@newline@pIt's an unusual and labor-intensive cake. First of all, the dough is rolled out like a cookie. It bakes into a pretty hard disk that will get mildly saturated with dried apples reconstituted with spices and sugar. The apples can't be fresh, and cheating the drying process is not acceptable. Electric fruit dehydrators save the effort of sun-drying apples on the porch or rigging an elaborate clothesline system in the atticall methods I was told about by people who have seen it done.p	1. Preheat the oven to 350F and place the rack in the middle position.@newline@2. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.@newline@3. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until wet and grainy.@newline@4. Add the molasses. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula to get all of the molasses into the mixture.@newline@5. Add the eggs one at a time. Scrape all the way to the bottom of the bowl and mix on low speed.@newline@6. Alternately add the buttermilk and the dry mixture about a quarter at a time. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl and turn it on again on low speed for about 10 seconds. The mixture should be stiff like a soft cookie dough.@newline@7. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.@newline@8. Divide the dough into 6 or 8 equal portions and place each one on a round piece of parchment paper a little larger than a 9-inch cake pan. Roll out the dough to the size of the parchment. Place the cake pan over the disk and trim away the excess around the edge.@newline@9. Leaving the parchment paper underneath, lift the disks onto baking sheets and bake them for approximately 10 minutes, or until the top surface appears dry and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.@newline@10. Slide the disks off the baking sheet onto a flat surface to cool.@newline@11. To make the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring to a light simmer. Immediately transfer to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse into a thick paste.@newline@12. To assemble the cake, spread about 1 cup of the filling onto each layer, taking care to center each disk on top of the one beneath it. Repeat until all the layers are used. Do not put apple filling on top of the cake.@newline@13. Wrap the cake well and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. This gives the apple filling time to work itself into the cake. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve chilled.	9
1109	Grilled Salmon with Quick Blueberry Pan Sauce	The sweet-tart pan sauce is a perfect partner for a rich fish like salmon.	Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat.

1112	Cherry Pie	Too tart to eat raw, sour cherries were born to be baked into a pie  this all-American version gets added sophistication from a gorgeously flaky crust and a filling, enhanced with an unexpected hint of cinnamon, that is not overly sweet.	Make dough: Blend together flour, butter, shortening, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle 5 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.@newline@Squeeze a small handful of dough: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated. Do not overwork, or pastry will be tough.@newline@Turn dough out onto a work surface and divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all dough together with pastry scraper. Divide dough with one half slightly larger, then form each piece into a ball and flatten each into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.	10
1113	Provencal Salad	The vegetables, along with the canned Italian tuna, in this colorful tossed salad create a positively satisfying meal.

1114	Mesclun Salad	Whether assertive farmers-market mesclun or a delicate supermarket mix, these greens require little more than a light lemony vinaigrette  and one that can be made quickly embraces the simplicity of the leaves.

Drain in sieve, then set sieve in same pot with 1 inch of simmering water (water should not touch bottom of sieve). Cover quinoa with a folded kitchen towel, then cover sieve with a lid (don't worry if lid doesn't fit tightly) and steam over medium heat until tender, fluffy, and dry, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and remove lid. Let stand, still covered with towel, 5 minutes.@newline@Add quinoa to dressing and toss until dressing is absorbed, then stir in remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste.	11
1116	Summer Pudding with Blueberries and Raspberries	A little easy preparation, plus time, yields a gorgeous old-fashioned English dessert that showcases summer berries in the most glorious way. The bread retains a bit of its texture and absorbs all the natural juices exuded by the berries for a cool, smooth intensity.	Cut bread into 14 (1/2-inch-thick) slices. Cut out a 3-inch round from 1 slice and put in bottom of bowl. Line side of bowl with 10 slices, overlapping them slightly.@newline@Bring berries, sugar, and lemon juice to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, then simmer, stirring occasionally, until berries collapse and release their juices, about 8 minutes.

Carefully unmold.	11
1117	Spinach Salad with Strawberry Vinaigrette	Spinach and strawberry salad had its moment in the '80s, but this version will surprise you with its refinement. The salad is not sweet, just aromatic  and coming across fresh berries every now and then provides bursts of fruitiness. The pecans are simply toasted, but once they're coated with vinaigrette, you'd swear they were candied. Raspberries would work well here, too.	Whisk together vinegar, a rounded 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking well. Put spinach, strawberries, and pecans in a large bowl and toss with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat.	5
1118	Stewed Corn and Tomatoes with Okra	If you haven't had maque choux  corn and tomatoes stewed together  you're really in for a treat. In this favorite Cajun dish, the corn gains a lush, savory sauciness, while the tomato benefits from the kernels' gentle chew. Here, okra is added and cooked just until tender, bringing its own unique texture to the mix.	Cook scallions, jalapeo, bell pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until scallions begin to brown, 7 to 9 minutes.

1119	Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken	As in the classic recipe from Richard Olney's Simple French Food that inspired this one, two key innovations ensure a moist, incredibly succulent chicken. First, the birds are spatchcocked, meaning they're butterflied and spread flat so that both the white meat and the dark can be perfectly cooked; second, an herbed-ricotta filling is pushed under the skin, puffing slightly during cooking and extending the meat's flavor in a creamy direction. Actually, you'll notice how much we liked the filling  we call for extra to be baked in a separate dish so that everyone gets a helping. The filling becomes a cross between a popover and a souffl in texture, with oregano and parsley supplying a suggestion of the Provenal countryside.	Make filling: Preheat oven to 400F with racks in middle and lower third.@newline@Cook garlic in oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in ricotta, eggs, parmesan, herbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.	9
1120	Ziti with Grilled-Gazpacho Sauce and Sausage	The classic cold soup seems almost restrained next to this lusty dish  gazpacho ingredients are grilled, then tossed with pasta and cheese (some of the vegetables are pured to make a tangy sauce that lightly cloaks the whole).

1122	Chocolate-Hazelnut Pudding	This luscious pudding offers a tasty hit of calcium to help build bones. If you can't find hazelnut-flavored chocolate, substitute 1/4 cup Nutella and use 3 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch instead of 2; the result will be milder in taste.	Stir cornstarch with 1/2 cup of the milk in a bowl until cornstarch completely dissolves. Heat remaining 1 1/2 cups milk, chocolate, sugar and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally, until chocolate melts. Raise heat to medium; cook, whisking occasionally, until almost boiling (steam will rise from the surface).

1130	Grilled Striped Bass with Orange-Saffron Butter	Look for fish that's 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick.

1146	Indian Clarified Butter	South Indians don't use ghee in cooking the way North Indians do, much preferring their coconut oil. But they always have a spoonful with their parboiled rice and dhal. The first step of a Sadhya is mixing ghee, rice, dhal, crushed pappadam, and a little salt. This mixture is eaten by hand and forms the first bites of the Sadhya. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.	Line a sieve with 3 layers of cheesecloth and set over a jar.@newline@Bring butter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat.

1148	The Dandy Lion	Stephen Cole, bartender at The Barrelhouse Flat in Chicago, created this dressed-up take on the classic gin and tonic for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p While you should feel free to use your favorite gin, for this absinthe-laced cocktail, Cole suggests trying Hayman's Old Tom Gin, which is slightly sweeter than more traditional English dry gin.	In a cocktail shaker, muddle the cucumber until slightly broken up, about 20 seconds. Add the absinthe and let macerate for about 30 seconds. Add the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup, then fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass (or any tall glass tumbler), top with tonic, and garnish with a cucumber slice.	4
1149	Rhubarb Collins	Jasper Soffer, bartender at the Mulberry Project in New York City, created this simple-to-prepare seasonal cocktail for our story pSpring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch.p The rhubarb simple syrup, Soffer explains, is simultaneously sweet and tart, not unlike a rhubarb-apple crumble or a strawberry-rhubarb pie. If you want to make this drink outside rhubarb's short early-spring season, frozen fruit makes a great substitute.	In a small pot, combine the rhubarb and sugar with 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until slightly thickened and bright pink in color, about 20 minutes. Let the syrup cool then pour through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Press down gently and discard the solids. DO AHEAD: The rhubarb simple syrup can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.@newline@In a cocktail shaker, combine 1 ounce of the rhubarb simple syrup with the gin and lemon juice. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a highball glass and top with Champagne or soda water.	7
1150	A Green Peas Soup, without Meat	This Mary Kettilby recipe produces a classic Potage St. Germain. The name comes from the Paris suburb of St.-Germain-en-Laye, where young peas, a rarity in the early eighteenth century, were sown in boxes for early-spring cultivation. The addition of onions and spinach provide a traditional French touch, making this soup a flavorsome beginning for spring menu.p	1. Put 8 cups of the peas and 4 cups of the water in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add the salt, pepper, mace, cloves, thyme, and marjoram, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the peas are very tender.@newline@2. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid in the sauceupan. Puree the peas in a food processor or with a food mill. If using a food mill, discard the skins. Press the puree through a sieve into the reserved liquid, stirring to combine thoroughly. Cover and set aside to keep warm.@newline@3. Combine the remaining 2 cups of peas with the remaining 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the peas are just tender.@newline@4. While the second batch of peas is cooking, melt the butter in a saut pan. Add the green onions, and saut for about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and mint and stir together, cooking until the spinach has just wilted. Blend in the flour, and cook for about 1 minute.@newline@5. Drain the peas, reserving the cooking liquid, and stir the peas into the warm soup along with the spinach mixture. Heat until it begins to simmer, adding the reserved pea-cooking liquida little at a timeif the soup is too thick. Season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.@newline@6. Pour the soup into a tureen, and garnish with diced toast and shredded calendula blossoms, if desired.	6
1151	To Make an Excellent Cherry Bounce	Among the few recipes known to have been used by the Washington family is this one for cherry bounce, a brandy-based drink popular in the eighteenth century. It seems to have been such a favorite of General Washington's that he packed a "Canteen" of it, along with Madeira and port, for a trip west across the Allegheny Mountains in September 1784.p	1. Pit the cherries, cut them in half, and put them in a large bowl. Using a potato masher, carefully mash the fruit to extract as much juice as possible. Strain the juice through a large fine-mesh strainer, pressing the fruit with a sturdy spoon. (You should have about 8 cups.) Reserve the mashed cherries in the freezer or refrigerator for later use. If using jarred cherries, drain the fruit and set the juice aside before halving and mashing the cherries. Add any pressed juice to the reserved jarred juice.@newline@2. In a lidded 1-gallon glass jar, combine the juice with the brandy and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover with the lid, and set aside in the refrigerator for 24 hours, occasionally stirring or carefully shaking the jar.@newline@3. Bring 2 cups of the juice to a simmer over medium heat. Taste the sweetened juice and add more sugar, if desired. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, cloves, and nutmeg. Then cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Strain, and discard the spices.@newline@4. Stir the spiced juice back into the 1-gallon glass jar with the reserved sweetened juice. Cover loosely with the lid, and set aside for at least 2 weeks before serving, occasionally shaking the jar with care.@newline@5. Serve at room temperature in small cordial or wine glasses. Store the remaining cherry bounce in the refrigerator.	5
1152	Chicken Biscuits	"Really good fried chicken and really good biscuitstogether, they're like Wonder Twin powers," says chef John Currence, owner of Big Bad Breakfast in Oxford, MS. For a no-fry, old-school treat, split biscuits and smother with pSausage Gravyp . Trust us, you'll be full.	For biscuits: Preheat oven to 400F. Place butter and shortening in freezer for 10 minutes.@newline@Blend 4 cups flour and next 5 ingredients in a food processor. Add butter and shortening. Pulse mixture until it resembles coarse meal, 20-25 pulses. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Gradually add buttermilk while tossing mixture with a fork (mixture will not be completely incorporated). Knead in bowl with lightly floured hands just until dough forms, about 3 turns.@newline@Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Pat out dough until 1" thick. Lift 1 side and fold it over.

1155	Tender Chanterelle Salad	Meaty chanterelles can stand up to a browning saut, but for this salad we prefer to steam the mushrooms for a tender and delicate texture.	Place mushrooms in a steamer basket and set over a pot filled with 1" gently simmering water (do not allow water to touch mushrooms). Cover and steam mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a baking sheet and let cool slightly.@newline@Meanwhile, whisk oil, parsley, vinegar, Dijon mustard, shallot, and garlic in a medium bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Add mushrooms; toss to coat evenly. Let marinate for 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.	4

Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.@newline@Remove plate and plastic from top of pudding. Invert onto a plate. Release pan sides; remove pan and plastic.	9
1158	Pine-Smoked & Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon	For all the robustness of the ingredients of this dish, the end result is notably delicate. One might ask, "Oh, but won't the bracing scent of pine make the dish taste of Christmas fir or, worse, freshly waxed parlor?" It will not. The smoked needles impart a light, balsamic flavor akin to rosemary (indeed one might substitute a bundle of that herb in this recipe), and the light glaze allows the pine flavor to shine through. The overall effect proves an excellent complement to the moist, flaky fish this cooking technique yields. Should one desire a more intensely flavored glaze, one might make a bit extra to brush over the fish before serving.	1. Prepare a medium-high-heat fire, with the flames occasionally licking the grill grate. Let it burn for at least 30 minutes. Whilst the fire heats, soak the pine needles in the bourbon.@newline@2. In a bowl, whisk together the syrup, mustard, and pepper. Season the salmon generously with salt and coat with the glaze.@newline@3. Place a large cast-iron skillet upon the grill grate. Let it heat until very hot. Using tongs or one's own gloved hand, press the needles into the bottom of the skillet, taking care not to drizzle combustible bourbon into the flames, and place the rack on top of the needles. Place the fish on top of the rack and cover the pan. Cook until the fish is just opaque, about 15 minutes for medium. Serve, brushed with additional glaze, if desired.	1
1159	Greens of the Wilderness Salad	The wilderness is filled with greens, from grassy glade and mossy rock to the leaves upon the trees. But how to celebrate this verdant splendor, when one eats neither grass nor moss, neither leaf-lined branch nor bud? The salad bowl is just the place for a pageant of greenery, as one can fill it with a tender mix of lush edibles scooped from the field. We prefer a wild salad to be austerely dressed; too much accessorizing can distract from its simple beauty. A drizzle of lemon and oil and perhaps a scattering of edible blooms are all that are needed here.	Tear the greens into bite-size pieces and drop them into a large salad bowl. Pour enough dressing over the salad to lightly coat the greens. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Garnish with edible flowers, if one strives for fanciness.	1
1160	Cumin Seed Roasted Cauliflower with Salted Yogurt, Mint, and Pomegranate Seeds	When the nights turn blustery and the temperature drops, I know that roasted vegetable season has arrived, and I embrace it with reckless abandon. I'll roast any kind of sturdy vegetable that I can cut up and fit into my oven, but one of my favorites is cauliflower, preferably tossed with whole cumin seeds. Not only does the cumin act as a natural remedy to help reduce the dreaded intestinal gas factor (or so I've been told), but it also adds a pleasant earthy flavor to balance the assertive tang of the vegetable.p	1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Toss the cauliflower with the oil, cumin seed, salt, and pepper. Spread the mixture in an even layer on a large baking sheet. Roast, tossing occasionally, until the cauliflower is tender and its edges are toasty, 20 to 30 minutes.@newline@2. Whisk a pinch of salt into the yogurt. Dollop the yogurt on top of the cauliflower and strew the mint and pomegranate seeds over the yogurt.	5
1161	Sweet Potato-Pork Belly Hash	Braising the pork belly yields crisp-tender nuggets ready to mingle with caramelized sweet potatoes. "It's a very American profile, sweet potato and pork," says Jared Wentworth, the chef at Chicago's Longman & Eagle, who gave us this recipe.	Preheat oven to 275F. Season pork belly generously with salt and pepper. Place in a large ovenproof saucepan. Add thyme and garlic. Pour stock over. Bring to a simmer over low heat, cover tightly, and braise in oven until tender, about 3 hours. Uncover; let cool. Transfer pork belly to a 9" glass pie dish. Place another 9" glass pie dish on top of pork belly. Weight with a 15-ounce canned good. Chill overnight.@newline@Remove skin from pork belly. Cut meat into 1/2" cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and saut until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a medium bowl. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Add to same skillet; saut until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with pork. Add 2 tablespoons oil and shallots to skillet; saut over medium heat until golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Return potatoes and pork with any accumulated juices to pan. Drizzle vinegar and syrup over; stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve with poached eggs if desired.	11
1162	Aged Rib Eye with Onion Pure	Dense, flavorful aged beef works best for this pan-roasted steak. If you use unaged beef, plan on shorter cooking times.	Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a 12" heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent (do not brown), 10-12 minutes. Add stock and 3/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover, and continue to simmer until onions are falling apart, about 20 minutes. Uncover and stir until onions are almost dry (do not brown), about 5 minutes. Transfer onions to a blender. Add buttermilk and 1 tablespoon water. Pure until smooth. Season with kosher salt.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F. Arrange a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil in a large cast-iron skillet or large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Season steak generously with kosher salt. Cook until a deep brown crust forms, 3-4 minutes per side and 1-2 minutes on edges. Place on prepared rack. Roast until a thermometer inserted into steak registers 115F, about 40 minutes. (Steak will carry over to medium-rare.) Let rest for 30 minutes.@newline@Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook until butter browns, about 2 minutes. Add steak and cook for 30 seconds per side, allowing steak to absorb butter. Cut steak into 4 slices. Place 1 steak slice on each plate and sprinkle with sea salt. Spoon warm onion pure alongside. Scatter herbs over pure.	5
1163	Thai Ginger Chicken Salad	The fresh herbs in this dish- part of the gluten-free menu at Boston's Myers + Chang-add flavor but not fat.

1167	Skillet-Roasted Chicken with Farro and Herb Pistou	"Talk to most chefs and they'll say they'd want a perfectly roasted chicken for their last meal," says Sean Brock. For his definitive version, Brock starts with superflavorful heritage-breed chickens, but the key to the dish is prepoaching the bird in an immersion circulator. Because most home cooks don't have access to this equipment, we adapted the recipe to work in a home kitchen.	Whisk 1/3 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon chives, and next 7 ingredients in a medium bowl. Divide marinade between 2 (gallon-size) resealable plastic freezer bags. Season chicken with 2 1/2 teaspoons salt; place 1 chicken half in each bag. Seal bags, releasing excess air. Chill overnight.@newline@Place bags side by side in a large pot. Add cold water to cover by 2". Heat water over medium heat until an instant-read thermometer registers 150F. Turn off heat, cover, and poach chicken for 50 minutes. Transfer bags to a large bowl of ice water to cool, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken from bags; pat dry.@newline@Preheat oven to 450F. Heat vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add chicken halves, skin side down, so chicken sits against sides of pan. Cook, moving chicken occasionally for even cooking, until skin is browned all over. Flip chicken and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165F, about 15 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes.@newline@To serve, divide Farro with Acorn Squash and Kale among plates. Place chicken on top of farro. Drizzle 1/4 cup Herb Pistou around farro. Drizzle 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil over each plate. Squeeze lemon halves over chicken. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons chives over.	2

1169	Carroty Mac and Cheese	Like most little kids, Dahlia loves macaroni and cheese, and I've made it for her in many guises, running the gamut of techniques. My aim is always the sameto make the dish quickly with a minimum of fuss, and to use a maximum of vegetables that she will tolerate and not pick out.p@newline@pThis is one of both our favorites. It's comforting, crusty topped, soft centered, and very cheesybut not at all sophisticated. Just simple, kid-friendly, homemade food with the added grown-up appeal of lots of healthful carrots tossed into the mix.p@newline@pI got the idea from a chef's recipe in a glossy food magazine. The chef called for cooking carrots in butter and orange juice, pureeing them, and using the puree as a sauce for mac and cheese. I tried the recipe as written and was disappointed. It was a lot of work, and I didn't like the sweetness of the citrus fruit interfering with my cheesy goodness.p@newline@pSo I decided to come up with my own simplified and ultra-Cheddary version. It was a huge hit with the under-three crowd and their parents, too.p	1. Preheat oven to 400F and grease an 8-inch square baking pan. Arrange a rack in the top third of the oven.@newline@2. Cook macaroni according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water; add carrot 3 minutes before pasta is finished cooking; drain well.@newline@3. While pasta is hot, stir in all but 1/2 cup of the cheddar and the butter. In a bowl, whisk together the sour cream, milk, eggs, salt, mustard powder, and pepper. Fold mixture into the pasta.@newline@4. Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheddar and the parmesan over the top. Bake until the casserole is firm to the touch and golden brown, about 30 minutes.	2
1170	D.I.Y. Ricotta	The recipe for this quick, fresh cheese from Mozza chef Nancy Silverton should be a part of every cook's repertoire. It calls for only four ingredients and takes just 30 minutes to make. While it's not technically ricotta (Italian for "recooked") because it's not made by reheating whey (the liquid left over from making mozzarella), it boasts a fresher flavor and creamier texture than the stuff in your supermarket dairy aisle.	1. Combine 4 cups whole milk, 1 cup cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a saucepan and bring just to a boil without stirring. Immediately remove pan from heat.@newline@2. Let mixture stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. As time passes, the curds will begin to separate from the whey. If only a few curds form, your lemons may not be acidic enough; add another 1 tablespoon lemon juice, gently stir so you don't break up the curds too much, and let stand for 5 minutes more.@newline@3. Using a large spoon (not slotted) or measuring cup, spoon curds into a cheeseclothlined sieve set over a large bowl. The longer you drain the ricotta, the denser and more flavorful the cheese will be. Add it to your favorite lasagna, or spread some on toast and drizzle it with honey for breakfast.	1

1180	Witches' Brew	Punch is one of the easiest ways to set the Halloween moodall you need is a cauldron, perhaps, or a pointy black hat and ice block "hands."Not every blend of fruit juices takes well to the with-or-without option of alcohol, but the combination of sparkling cider and cranberry juice cocktail, subtly enhanced with a spice syrup, both support an optional dose of dark rum.

1181	Devil's Food Cake with Chocolate Spiderweb	In name alone, a devil's food cake is an obvious choice for a Halloween dessert. This one will far exceed your expectations of deep chocolaty naughtiness hidden under a fluff of espresso-tinged frosting. (If your trick-or-treaters are too young to embrace the slightly adult bitterness the coffee flavor adds, feel free to substitute a couple of teaspoons of good old vanilla extract.) Have some fun with a very tasty spiderwebyou'll want to eat it rather than shriek and brush it off.	Make cake: Preheat oven to 350F with racks in upper and lower thirds.

1184	Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad	I met twelve-year-old Frank Liranzo when I was teaching a kids' cooking class at the YMCA's environmental camp in Huguenot, New York. The kids learned how to tap trees to make maple syrup, a process I'd read about but never seen in action. Frank was one of the campers, and he got to experience firsthand the old art of making maple syrup. "You put tubes into the trees so the sap flows out," he says. "When it first comes out of the tree, it tastes like sugary water. Then we went to the sugar shack where we saw the sap boiled down until it tasted like syrup." At the camp, I made this Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad for the kids. "I thought it would taste really sugary, but it didn't," Frank told me. "First I tasted the fish, then a hint of mustard, and then an aftertaste of the maple syrup." I love how the syrup adds sweetness and a beautiful caramelized crust to the meaty tuna steaks, while the sweetness of the pears in the accompanying potato salad balances nicely with the glazed tuna.	1. Whisk together the mustard, maple syrup, lime juice, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Set aside.@newline@2. Season the tuna on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the tuna and cook for 30 seconds on each side.@newline@3. Remove from the pan and brush both sides of the tuna with the maple-mustard glaze. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with the cilantro. Serve with the pear-potato salad.	6

Add the chicken breasts, bay leaves, and oregano and decrease the heat to a simmer. Cook the chicken, partially covered, for 35 minutes, or until cooked through. To check for doneness, slit the chicken in half to make sure the interior is no longer pink.@newline@Allow the chicken to cool in the broth. When cool enough to handle, remove the chicken from the pan. Strain and reserve the broth. Shred the chicken by hand by pulling apart the fibers of the chicken with your fingers and set aside.	12
1186	Crab Tostadas	I often wonder if tostadascrisp tortillas mounded with your choice of toppingwere the first version of modern-day nachos. If so, these would definitely be called "supreme." Crunchy tortillas are layered with slices of creamy avocado and topped with a zesty crab salad to make the perfect appetizer.	Prepare the Crabmeat Put the crabmeat in a bowl. Pick through it with your fingers to remove any cartilage.	4
1187	Chickpea Spread	This is a Greek version of hummus that captures the soul of the Mediterranean. For this recipe, be sure to use premium-quality imported sun-dried tomatoes; they should be plump and soft with red hue.	Brush the onion slices with a little olive oil and season with kosher salt and pepper. On a hot griddle pan or in a cast-iron skillet, grill until tender and slightly char-marked.@newline@In a food processor, combine the grilled onion, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, shallots, basil, and cumin. Pulse into a chunky pure. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, then the lemon juice. The mixture should be quite smooth.@newline@Transfer to a large bowl and add the Chickpea Confit. Fold together to blend. Return to the food processor in batches, and pure until the mixture is smooth and thick. Season to taste with pepper and salt (if the sun-dried tomatoes are very salty, you may not need much). The texture is a matter of taste; if it is very thick, add a little more olive oil to yield a creamier result. Well covered, the spread will last for at least a week in the refrigerator.	6
1188	Tzatsiki	This is the one sauce you pmustp make. It's a classic and very easy to prepare, but be sure you use only a superior quality Greek yogurt or labne spread. I cannot emphasize this strongly enoughit makes all the difference.	Quarter the cucumber lengthwise and trim off the triangular wedge of seeds. Cut the cucumber into a very small, even dice. Transfer it to a mixing bowl.@newline@In a food processor, combine the garlic, vinegar, shallots, and dill. Pulse until finely chopped but not pured. Add the mixture to the cucumbers; add the yogurt. Fold together with a rubber spatula, adding olive oil and lemon juice. Season liberally with kosher salt and pepper, starting off with 1 tablespoon salt. Taste for seasoning. You can store Tzatsiki in a covered, clean jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.	8
1189	Black and Orange Halloween Pasta	Cooking by color might not be the surest way to devise holiday-appropriate recipes, but who can resist the lure of black linguine on Halloween? Tossing it with pumpkin-hued vegetables lusty with garlic and hot pepper might seem like hobgoblin overkill, except that the flavors work well together. Really well. So much so that you'll be making this pasta combination again and again, long after the jack-o-lanterns have disappeared.	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Toss squash and bell peppers with garlic, thyme, red pepper flakes, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a 17- by 11-inch 4-sided sheet pan.

Stir in olives, then add vegetable mixture to pasta in pot and toss to combine.	10
1190	Poppy Cheddar Moon Crackers	Too often crackers get short shrift as merely vehicles for a slice or smear of cheese. Not here. By incorporating cheese into the dough, along with the tiny crunch of poppy seeds, these crackers become crisp snacks that keep your fingers reaching for another and then another and, well, you know how it goes. In no time, they're history.	Whisk together flour, cornmeal, poppy seeds, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Blend in butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cheese and 4 Tbsp cold water and mix with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated. If mixture is still dry, add enough of remaining tablespoon cold water until mixture holds together to form a soft dough.@newline@Turn out dough onto a work surface. With heel of your hand, smear dough 3 or 4 times in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together, with a pastry scraper if you have one, then divide dough in half. Press each half into a disk, then chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, about 1 hour.@newline@Preheat oven to 400F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface (keep remaining disk chilled until ready to use) with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round and cut out as many crescent moons as possible with cutter. Transfer to baking sheets, arranging them 1/2 inch apart. Gather scraps, then reroll and cut out.@newline@Lightly beat egg with warm water in a small bowl for egg wash. Lightly brush crescents with egg wash and prick all over with a fork, then sprinkle with sea salt. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through, until golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool completely on sheets on racks. Make more crackers with remaining dough (cool baking sheets between batches).	8
1191	Chowders	Traditional chowders all start off with a hearty soup base of onions and potatoes, and that makes a good soup just by itself. To this fragrant base you then add chunks of fish, or clams, or corn, or whatever else seems appropriate. (Note: You may leave out the pork and substitute another tablespoon of butter for sauting the onions.)	Saut the pork or bacon bits slowly with the butter in a large saucepan for 5 minutes, or until pieces begin to brown. Stir in the onions and bay leaf; cover, and cook slowly 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are tender. Drain off fat and blend crackers or bread crumbs into onions. Pour in the liquid; add the potatoes and simmer, loosely covered, for 20 minutes or so, until the potatoes are tender. Season to taste with salt and white pepper, and the soup base is ready.	1
1192	Roasted Leg of Lamb with North African Spices, Lemon, and Onions	I call this herb and spice rub North African because, besides the classic oregano and rosemary, it contains Tunisian and Moroccan spices such as caraway, cumin, and turmeric. In addition, it is spiked with harissa, the ubiquitous hot pepper paste that is to Arab North Africa what chile oil is to Asia. Use the same spice mixture to rub poultry, beef, or pork two to three hours before grilling and leave at room temperature. Or you can mix 3 tablespoons of this rub with 3 tablespoons yogurt and baste chicken breasts or legs or skewered lamb and pork before grilling. Better yet, leave in the spicy yogurt marinade in the refrigerator overnight.	In a spice grinder, a clean coffee grinder, or a mortar, grind the salt, oregano, rosemary, caraway, cumin, and turmeric to a fine powder. Transfer to a bowl and add the harissa and chopped garlic. Add the olive oil to make a thick paste. Make 8 or 9 deep slits all over the lamb and insert some of the spice paste, rubbing the paste all over the surface of the meat. Cover and let stand for 1 hour at room temperature or, preferably, refrigerate for at least 5 hours or overnight. Bring to room temperature before roasting.@newline@Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the leg of lamb fat side down in a roasting pan that will hold the onions in one layer. Roast for 20 minutes. Mix the lemon juice and wine in a small bowl. Turn the meat and pour the lemon-wine mixture over it. (If you are roasting the lamb in a clay dish, warm the mixture first, because cold liquid can cause the clay to crack.) Reduce the oven temperature to 375F and roast for 35 minutes, basting every 10 to 15 minutes with the pan juices. If the pan dries out, add a little more wine.@newline@Transfer the lamb to a plate and add the onions to the pan, tossing them well to coat them with the pan juices. Add the rosemary sprigs or sprinkle with dried rosemary, toss, place the lamb on the onions, and continue roasting, basting often, for another 30 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 135F. Transfer the meat to a heated platter, cover with a double layer of aluminum foil, and set aside. (Leave the oven on.) If the pan juices are watery, transfer most of them to a saucepan and cook briefly to reduce.@newline@Meanwhile, return the pan to the oven and continue baking the onions until tender, with browned edges. Turn the oven to broil. Place the lamb on the onions again and broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the surface is deep brown and crackling. Carve the lamb and serve, passing the pan juices in a bowl or sauceboat at the table.	4
1193	Asparagus Velout	NoDescription	1. Wash the asparagus. Cut 2 inches (5 cm.) off the tips and save them for another use. Do not peel the stalks but cut them into 15-inch (3-cm.) pieces.@newline@2. Bring the stock or broth to a boil in a soup pot. When it bubbles, add the asparagus pieces and sugar. Turn down the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.@newline@3. Blend and pass through a fine strainer (a chinois if possible), pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Put the soup back in the pot, bring back to a boil, and boil about 30 minutes more.@newline@4. Thoroughly mix the cornstarch in a bowl with 1 tablespoon cold water. Beat the yolk and cream together in a bowl large enough to hold all the soup.@newline@5. When the soup in the pot has been reduced by about half, whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Boil for 1 minute, whisking constantly, and then gently pour everything into the bowl with the egg-cream mixture, whisking as you pour.@newline@6. Pour the contents of the bowl back into the soup pot and heat very gently in order to thicken. Stir with a spatula and turn off the heat at the first sign of boiling. Blend. Season with salt as necessary.	8
1194	Limoncello Tiramis	One of the delights of making tiramis is its versatility. This recipe makes a family-style dessert in a large dish, but you can easily compose single servings in dessert glasses, wine goblets, or even elegant teacups for a more impressive presentation, in the style of Signora Garatti's original "coppa imperiale." And while the conventional version of tiramis calls for espresso soaked savoiardi, I've found that other flavors can be incorporated into the dessert with great success. Here, the brightness of fresh lemons and limoncello liqueur lace the cream and soaking syrup to make for a tiramis that is refreshing and irresistible.	Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs, putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.@newline@Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.@newline@To make the base for the tiramis, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and  cup of the limoncello until well blended.@newline@Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.@newline@Meanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan.@newline@Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.@newline@In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks. When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.@newline@Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie brieflyif it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.@newline@Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream. Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramis airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramis in any size you like, and lift each out of the pan onto dessert plates.	12
1195	Braised Turnip Greens with Turnips and Apples	Spicy, sharp turnip greens, braised gently with a smoked ham hock, are a time-honored accompaniment on southern tables at any time of the year. Add in the turnips, plus lots of apple, and the dish tastes lighter and more delicate. It's also very pretty, with the ivory turnips, golden apple, and pink ham nestled among the dark greens.	Bring greens, ham hock, water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a large heavy pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until greens are almost tender, about 20 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, peel apples and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.@newline@Add turnips and apples to greens with vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and cook at a bare simmer, covered, stirring and turning ham hock occasionally, until turnips and apples are tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in butter and salt to taste.@newline@Remove ham hock and finely chop any tender meat, discarding skin, bone, and tough meat. Add chopped meat to pot.	3
1196	Cranberry and Celery Relish	Food editor Andrea Albin, who developed this menu, says that her mom, Veronica, who lives in Houston, should get all the glory here. Raw celery and toasted almonds lace cooked cranberries with terrific crunch.	Simmer cranberries, sugar, water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a heavy medium saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of cranberries have burst, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely.@newline@Just before serving, stir in celery and almonds.	3
1197	Bourbon Pumpkin Pie	For many, Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie is unthinkable, but that doesn't mean you can't jazz up the old standby. A judicious hand with the spices lends this custardy version a certain lightness of being. There is a bit of tang, too, from sour cream, and an underlying warmth from the jigger of bourbon (to amplify the depth of flavor, add some to the whipped cream accompaniment, too).	Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round and fit into pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang under and lightly press against rim of pie plate, then crimp decoratively. Lightly prick bottom all over with a fork. Chill until firm, at least 30 minutes (or freeze 10 minutes).@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake until side is set and edge is golden, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove weights and foil and bake shell until golden all over, 10 to 15 minutes more. Cool completely.@newline@Whisk together remaining ingredients and pour into cooled shell.@newline@Bake until edge of filling is set but center trembles slightly, about 45 minutes (filling will continue to set as it cools). Cool completely.	4
1198	Cheddar Corn Muffins with Jalapeo Butter	The bread basket just became a little more exciting. These savory muffins are made with white cornmealfavored over yellow by many southern cooksand strewn with corn kernels and shreds of cheese. Albin considered putting jalapeo into the muffins but prefers the fresher, more vibrant color and flavor it offers in the butter.	Make corn muffins: Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle. Brush muffin cups with softened butter.@newline@Whisk together cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl.@newline@Whisk together corn, buttermilk, egg, and melted butter in another bowl, then stir into flour mixture until just combined. Stir in 1 1/2 cups cheese.@newline@Divide batter among muffin cups and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake until puffed and golden-brown and a wooden pick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.	11
1199	Old-Fashioned Pecan Pie	It's impossible to go wrong with pecan pie. Especially one that is really loaded with nuts, has a little verve from orange zest, and isn't overly sweetexactly like the one here. Taking the time to track down new-crop pecans will push things right over the top.	Preheat oven to 350F with a baking sheet on middle rack.@newline@Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang under and lightly press against rim of pie plate, then crimp decoratively. Lightly prick bottom all over with a fork. Chill until firm, at least 30 minutes (or freeze 10 minutes).@newline@Meanwhile, melt butter in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar, whisking until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in corn syrup, vanilla, zest, and salt. Lightly beat eggs in a medium bowl, then whisk in corn syrup mixture.@newline@Put pecans in pie shell and pour corn syrup mixture evenly over them. Bake on hot baking sheet until filling is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool completely.	5

1208	Marbleized Eggs	These pretty swirled patterns are made by passing an egg through a bath of enamel paint suspended in water. The process is easy and the pleasantly unpredictable results are always a surprise.	1. Decide the color or combinations you want to useyou may use one or more colors of paint for each marbling bath.@newline@2. For each bath, fill a roasting pan with about 4 inches of water. Put on the rubber gloves. Add about 1 teaspoon of each color paint in the chosen combination. Swirl the end of a skewer through the paint.@newline@3. Place an egg on the end of a skewer. Swirl it around through the paint and water. When the paint has adhered to the egg in a marbled pattern, remove the egg from the skewer to an egg carton and let it dry.@newline@4. Repeat this process for each egg, using the different color marbleizing baths as you wish.@newline@5. To dispose of paint responsibly, pour each bath slowly through a coffee filter, letting the water drain down the sink and capturing the paint. Throw away the paint.	5
1209	Chocolate-Filled Delights	Imagine the surprise of friends who open these hard-boiled look-alikes to find them filled with chocolate. Give yourself time to make these; they need sufficient drying and hardening before they can be enjoyed.	1. Spatter each egg: If you wish, cover your worktable with newspaper. Slide the eggs onto skewer on a Styrofoam drying rack (see tip, below). Dip the paintbrush in the food coloring, hold it in one hand above the egg and run your thumb along the bristles or tap the handle to create a spray of paint. Revolve each egg to splatter the entire surface. Allow the eggs to dry for several hours.@newline@2. Seal the hole in the wider end of each blown egg with a small piece of masking tape. Using the pliers, gently chip away the shell around the other hole, enlarging it to the size of a pea. Place the eggs in an egg carton, open-end up.@newline@3. One at a time, fill the eggs with chocolate: Place 1 cup of the baking chips in a food storage bag and twist the bag like a pastry bag to secure the chips in one bottom corner. Microwave on medium for 1 minute, until soft. Snip the corner from the bag and pipe the chocolate into the egg, tapping the egg periodically to compress any air bubbles and filling it completely, to the top of the hole.@newline@4. Refrigerate the eggs overnight so the chocolate is firm. Remove the masking tape. Store in the refrigerator if not eating soon.@newline@5. Tap the eggs on the table to crack the shells, and peel. Yum.	7

1215	Grilled Black Cod with Fried Garlic and Chiles	It's Basque chefs like Juan Mari Arzak and Martin Berasategui who grab the headlines for their culinary pyrotechnics (think of their food as the culinary equivalent of the Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao). But what you may not realize is that the Basque country is also a hotbed of grillingdone by and large with a simplicity that stands in striking contrast to the foams, jellies, and deconstructions of Spain's culinary avant-garde. A sprinkle of sea salt, a splash of vinegar or olive oilthese are the seasonings favored by the majority of Basque grill masters. Consider this simple grilled cod topped with olive oil and fried garlicinspired by Beti-Jai ("always a holiday"), a popular restaurant tucked away in the warren of narrow streets in the old quarter of Donostia-San Sebastin.	Lightly brush fish grill basket with oil (if using), or brush grill rack with oil, and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle fish on both sides with coarse salt and pepper.

1218	Turkey Shawarma with Tomato Relish and Tahini Sauce	Shawarmap is the Middle Eastern version of a large vertical shish kebab known as pdoner kebabp in Turkey and pgyrop in Greece. It's made by impaling layers of meat on an oversize spit with a flat base and roasting the meat in an upright rotisserie. There are at least three advantages to this singular method of cooking. The dripping fat bastes the meat below it; the meat is sliced to order (at least it should be) from the outside, which gives every customer a crusty end cut; and because the crusty meat slices are piled on pita bread with fresh vegetables, pickles, and tahini sauce, you get a whole mealand a healthful onein a single sandwich. Traditionally, pshawarmap was made with lamb, but more and more Israeli grill masters use thinly sliced chicken or turkey. pShawarmap is easy to prepare if you have a vertical rotisserie, and somewhat more challenging to adapt to the home grill. But direct-grilling the turkey slices does give you a close approximation of the taste and texture of classic pshawarmap.	Arrange turkey cutlets in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Spread onion slices in 13x9x2- inch glass baking dish. Mix turmeric, coarse salt, ground coriander, ground cumin, black pepper, white pepper, and hot paprika in small bowl. Sprinkle onion slices with 1 tablespoon spice mixture, then drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over, turning onions to coat both sides. Sprinkle remaining spice mixture over both sides of turkey cutlets, rubbing in spice mixture with fingertips to coat. Drizzle 4 tablespoons olive oil over turkey, turning cutlets to coat both sides. Cover and chill onions and turkey at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.@newline@Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill rack with oil. Brush pita breads with 2 tablespoons oil. Grill onion slices until tender, about 4 minutes per side. Grill turkey cutlets until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Grill pita breads until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer turkey cutlets and onion slices to cutting board and keep pita breads warm. Working in batches, stack several turkey slices and cut thinly crosswise. Repeat stacking and cutting with onion slices. Mix together turkey and onions in large bowl. Place 1 pita bread on each of 8 plates. Top with turkey-onion mixture, then Tomato Relish, Tahini Sauce, and eggplant and serve.@newline@* Eggplant packed in a pickling brine of water, vinegar, salt, herbs, and spices; sold at Middle Eastern markets.	3

1264	Roasted Carrots	We love the rainbow of carrots now available at farmers and specialty markets: pink, purple, mauve, cobalt, white, yellow. The brilliant colors beneath green tops add a festive note to this dish, but its still prettyand deliciouswhen made with only orange carrots.

1265	Vanilla-Poached Pineapple	"I've never been keen on pineapple," food editor Paul Grimes admits, "so I challenged myself to make a pineapple dessert that I would actually like." Charring the wine-poached fruit caramelizes it and softens its acidity while highlighting its floral notes. With vanilla and a cidery syrup, this dessert feels at once wintery and light.	Peel pineapple, then quarter lengthwise. Cut out core, then cut each quarter lengthwise into 4 pieces (for a total of 16).@newline@Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into a 12-inch heavy skillet with tip of a paring knife, then add pod, wine, Grand Marnier, brown sugar, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, cloves, and a large pinch of salt.

1266	Shrimp in Dill Butter	In this marriage of give and take, shallot-dill butter makes jumbo shrimp taste as sweet as langoustines. In return, the shrimp impart their juices to the butter as they bake, creating a silky sauce. With toasted brioche in hand, youll want to sop up every last drop.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Cut bread into 24 (2- by 1-inch) rectangles, then bake in a 4-sided sheet pan, turning once or twice, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. (Leave oven on.)

1267	Coconut Oatmeal Lace Cookies	An upscale hybrid of antipodean ANZAC biscuits and chocolate digestives from Britain, these crisp cookies are positively elegant. They were an unexpected favorite in our test kitchen, with cooks and editors descending in droves when the cookies warm, nutty aroma filled the air.

1269	Orange Pudding Cake	As this cake bakes, it separates into a souffl-like layer on top and citrusy pudding on the bottom. While it's not really magic, it certainly looks and tastes like it.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter a 1 1/2-quart gratin or other shallow baking dish.@newline@Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from 1 orange, then squeeze 1/2 cup juice from oranges.@newline@Whisk together sugar, flour, and salt in a large bowl.@newline@Whisk together yolks, milk, butter, zest, orange juice, and lemon juice in a small bowl and add to flour mixture, whisking until just combined.@newline@Beat egg whites in another large bowl with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks.

1272	Chipotle Chicken Tortilla Soup	Chicken soup is an automatic crowd-pleaser, but this Mexican-inspired tortilla soup does the classic one better. Homemade broth is key here, providing a base for brown rice, black beans, and chunks of sweet potato. Cooling pieces of avocado play off of a warm, earthy undercurrent of chipotle chiles.	Make stock: Bring all stock ingredients to a boil with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in an 8-to 10-quart heavy pot, then skim foam.@newline@Reduce heat and gently simmer, uncovered, skimming foam occasionally, 2 3/4 hours.@newline@Transfer chicken to a cutting board, then pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard solids. Reserve@newline@1 cup stock and return remainder to cleaned pot.	9
1273	Zucchini Latkes	Add a little color to the Festival of Lights with zucchini pancakes that shine green.

Transfer to a bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons salt. Let stand 30 minutes.@newline@Squeeze zucchini in batches in a kitchen towel to remove as much liquid as possible.

1274	Tuscan Lamb Shanks with White Beans	Far from being a culinary museum piece, the pressure cooker deserves a place in the 21st-century kitchen. One reason: You can make this hearty Italian meal of incredibly tender lamb with vegetables and saucy beans in about an hour.

1277	Almond Brown-Sugar Cookies	With their simple, homespun charm, these icebox cookies are just the nibble you'll want to have on hand as you do your Christmas gift wrapping. The thinner you can slice the dough, the crisper the cookies will be, so we freeze the dough for a bit (after chilling it in the fridge) before slicing. Plus, it will be much easier to cut through the almonds and get nice, neat rounds.	Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg and vanilla. At low speed, mix in flour mixture until a dough just forms. Stir in whole almonds. Divide dough in half. Using a sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper as an aid, form each piece of dough into a log 9 to 9 1/2 inches long (about 1 1/4 inches in diameter). Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until very firm, at least 4 hours. Freeze 30 minutes to facilitate slicing.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut 1 log of dough crosswise into slices less than 1/8 inch thick with a thin sharp knife, rotating log after each slice to help keep round shape. (If dough gets too soft to slice through nuts easily, freeze briefly.) Arrange cookies about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets.@newline@Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer cookies on parchment to racks to cool.@newline@Repeat with remaining dough (cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment).	8
1278	Roasted Winter Vegetable Baklava	Traditionally, baklava is a Middle Eastern dessert, but we fell head over heels for this savory rendition. Roasting coaxes out the earthy magic in hearty root vegetables and fennel, which are then tossed with fresh dill and baked in walnut-layered phyllo until it's golden brown.	Preheat oven to 425F with racks in upper and lower thirds.@newline@Pulse walnuts with bread crumbs in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped (not ground).@newline@Peel potatoes and slice 1/4 inch thick.

1280	Twelve-Layer Mocha Cake	What better way to celebrate the holidays than with something fabulous? In this elegant European-style cake, thin layers of different flavors come together in each bite. Fine-textured spongecake, soaked in espresso syrup, plays off of crisp hazelnut meringue, while the coffee and mocha buttercreams intensify the richness of a collapsed chocolate souffl. The faint, bitter edge of dark coffee essentially saves this dessert from itself.	Make cake layers: Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter 1 sheet pan and line bottom with parchment paper, then butter parchment.

1281	Kale and Potato Pure	At first glance, your guests will think this is creamed spinach. One bite and they'll be thrilled to find it's much more exciting than that. Kale, a hearty green, brightens potatoes that have been cooked in cream. Smooth and substantial, this dish is a welcome foil for ppork roast with winter fruitsp or other roasted meats.

1286	Maple and Black-Pepper Bacon	"I'm hot-rodding bacon here," said food editor Melissa Roberts, "making it extra-special with a fragrant hit of pepper over a sweet glaze." Rendering the bacon before it's brushed with maple syrup and finished in the oven results in strips with a spectacular crunch.	Preheat oven to 375F with racks in upper and lower thirds.@newline@Arrange bacon slices in 1 layer (not overlapping) on racks of 2 large broiler pans (if you only have one, use a large rectangular metal rack set inside a large baking pan for the second).

1289	Orange Pistachio Crescents	Inspired by the Persian fried-turnover cookies called ghotab, food editor Shelley Wiseman used a simple dough to enfold fragrant candied orange peel and pistachios. Her method for candying the peel is very straightforward, and the resultstender and fresh-tastingare so much better than the store-bought stuff. The flaky baked pastry, generously coated with confectioners sugar, pairs nicely with the chewy-crunchy filling within.	Make dough: Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl (or pulse in a food processor).

1290	Dulce de Leche Half-Moons	Known as ppepitoriasp, these tasty caramel-filled wafer "tacos" embellished with toasted pumpkin seeds are a regular offering at Mexican markets and sweets shops, especially in the city of Puebla, which is famous for so many confections. The wafers are traditionally brightly colored, but we chose to stick with a more seasonal white-and-gold motif. Since tinted edible wafer paper is hard to come by in the United States, we used precut white Back-Oblaten, imported from Germany, and we explain how to color them. Painting them with food coloring or water softens them enough to fold around the caramel.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. 3Spread seeds in a 4-sided sheet pan and toast in oven until puffed and slightly golden (but not browned), 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely on a plate.@newline@Stir 1/4 teaspoon colored powder into 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl until dissolved.@newline@Spread 10 wafers in 1 layer on a rack. Paint tops of wafers lightly with coloring using a pastry brush (for white wafers, brush with water). Let stand until pliable, 3 to 5 minutes (if too wet to lift, let stand until slightly drier). Invert wafers, then spoon a level teaspoon dulce de leche onto unpainted side of each. Fold each in half, pressing to spread dulce de leche just to edge. Insert 8 seeds halfway into _dulce de leche_dulce de leche is firm enough to hold seeds in place, 1 to 4 hours.@newline@Meanwhile, paint remaining wafers with remaining colors, 1 color at a time. Make more confections in same manner.	4

1305	Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good	Shortly after I was given this recipe, I started keeping a list of whom I'd made it forbecause I loved it so much, I was sure that if I didn't keep track, I'd end up serving the dish to the same people over and over. The idea for it came from my friend Hlne Samuel's sister, Catherine, whose husband grows pumpkins on his farm just outside Lyon. Catherine sent me a charming outline of the recipe, and as soon as I'd baked my first pumpkin, I realized that an outline is about the best you can do with this dish. It's a hollowed-out pumpkin stuffed with bread, cheese, garlic, and cream, and since pumpkins come in unpredictable sizes, cheeses and breads differ, and baking times depend on how long it takes for the pumpkin to get soft enough to pierce with a knife, being precise is impossible.p@newline@pAs Catherine said when she turned this family favorite over to me, "I hope you will put the recipe to good use, knowing that it's destined to evolve . . . and maybe even be improved."p@newline@pWell, I've certainly been putting it to good use, and it has evolved, although I'm not sure that it's been improved, since every time I make it, it's different, but still wonderful. My guess is that you'll have the same feeling once you start playing around with this "outline." See Bonne Ide for some hints on variations.p	Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the potwhich is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky.@newline@Using a very sturdy knifeand cautioncut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween Jack-o-Lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot.@newline@Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepperyou probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sureand pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filledyou might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too littleyou don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (It's hard to go wrong here.)@newline@Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hourscheck after 90 minutesor until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.@newline@When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefullyit's heavy, hot, and wobblybring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table.	10
1306	Sabl Galette Cookies	This is the easiest cookie you will ever bake. It is made as one large cookie that you cut after baking. Sabl means sandblasted, which describes the grainy texture of these cookies perfectly. I saw cookies like these during my travels around Brittany in the northwest region of France, where they use enormous amounts of butter in everything they bake. For a Sephardic twist, I like to add orange blossom water to this parve version of the famous French cookie.	1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Place the flour, margarine, salt and 1/2 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse about seven times, or until the mixture looks like sand. You can also do this by hand in a large bowl with two knives or a pastry cutter. Add 1 egg yolk, the vanilla, orange blossom water, if using, and the tablespoon of cold water. Process or mix just until the dough comes together.@newline@2. Place a large piece of parchment on the counter and grease lightly using the paper or foil wrapper that wrapped the margarine. Dump the dough onto the greased parchment and, using a rolling pin, roll into a large circle, about 9 inches in diameter.@newline@3. To decorate the edge of the cookie, using the flat end of the handle of a wooden spoon, or the tip of your index finger, make indentations one after the other all around the outside of the circle.@newline@4. Whisk together the remaining egg yolk with the 1/2 tablespoon of water. Brush the top of the cookie with egg wash. Using the tines of a fork, make one set of lines straight across the top of the cookie. Make another set about 2 inches below the first. Repeat until you have four to five sets of lines. Now slide the parchment a quarter turn to the right and make four to five additional sets of lines, each about 2 inches apart. The new set of lines should cross the first set of lines on an angle, creating a diamond-shaped grid.@newline@5. Sprinkle the top of the cookie with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Slide the parchment onto a cookie sheet and bake for 35 to 37 minutes, until the edges start to look golden. Remove from the oven and immediately cut the cookie into 8 or 12 large wedges or about eighteen 1 x 3-inch bars, if you like. If you wait until the cookie cools to cut it, you will not get nice clean edges.	1
1307	Chocolate Pudding Pie	Phyllis Roberts, the mother of food editor Melissa Roberts, was a working mom who cooked dinner every night, including salad and dessert. One of Melissa's favorite treats was chocolate cream pie, made with MypTpFine boxed pudding. In honor of her mother, Melissa has updated this dessert with a flaky piecrust and a filling of rich, homemade chocolate pudding (which is as easy to make as, well, pie). Finally, she crowns it all with drifts of whipped cream and chocolate shavings.	Make dough: Blend together flour, butter, shortening, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle 2 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.@newline@Squeeze a small handful of dough: If dough doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until incorporated. (Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.)@newline@Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all of dough together, with a pastry scraper if you have one, and form into a 5-inch disk. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.	5
1308	Chocolate Cherry Bombe	With its mischievous cherry-stem fuse and sleek chocolate shell, this ice cream bombe should definitely get the fireworks started at your Fourth of July cookout. Cut into the bombe and you'll see cherry ice cream dotted with crisp chocolate wafer cookies and toasty walnuts. Look even further and you'll find the gunpowderer, a center of chocolate ice cream.	Line bowl with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang all around.@newline@Stir walnuts and chocolate cookies into cherry ice cream in another bowl. Transfer ice cream to lined bowl and spread evenly over bottom and up sides, leaving a crater in center. Freeze until firm, about 45 minutes.@newline@Scoop chocolate ice cream into crater in cherry ice cream, then smooth top with an offset spatula. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.@newline@Meanwhile, melt chocolate with butter and oil in a heatproof medium bowl set over a pot of simmering water, stirring. Remove from heat and cool slightly.@newline@Invert bombe onto a rack set over a baking sheet and remove plastic wrap. Make a small indentation in top and place maraschino cherry into ice cream so that the cherry is submerged but stem sticks straight up (like a fuse).@newline@Ladle chocolate sauce on top of bombe (avoiding cherry stem), letting it drip over sides to coat thoroughly. Freeze until chocolate coating is set, about 30 minutes.@newline@To serve, cut into wedges.	10
1309	Frozen Fudge Pops	Some of us remember clamoring for a fudge pop as soon as we heard the jingle of the ice cream truck. Others reminisce about walking down to the corner store on a sultry August afternoon, reaching into the frosty ice chest for one of these frozen treats, and then peeling back the thin paper wrapper for that first cool bite. These homemade fudge pops, which call for just five ingredients you may already have on hand, will bring your memories to life: They taste smooth, deeply chocolaty, just right.	Heat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, corn syrup, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool to room temperature or quick-chill in an ice bath. Pour into molds and freeze 30 minutes. Insert sticks (if using), then freeze until firm, about 24 hours.@newline@Run hot water over molds (or dip in hot water) to loosen pops before unmolding.	6
1310	Corn Dogs	When executive editor John Willoughby caught sight of these freshly fried corn dogs, he exclaimed, "Just like the Iowa State Fair!" When he bit into one, he acknowledged that it was even better. Grilling the hot dogs first lends them a deeper, smokier flavor, and the buttermilkcornmeal coating fries up to a thick, fluffy shelldelicious with mustard or ketchup and a frosty root beer on the side.	Oil grill pan, then grill hot dogs over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly charred on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and cool slightly, then insert a wooden stick into each hot dog. Put 3 tablespoons flour on another plate and roll hot dogs in flour to coat, shaking off excess.@newline@Heat 3 inches oil to 350F in a deep 3-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat.@newline@Meanwhile, whisk together cornmeal, remaining 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, baking powder, sugar, baking soda, cayenne, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add eggs 1 at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in buttermilk.@newline@Transfer some of batter to a tall glass, filling it almost to the top.@newline@Working in batches of 2 or 3, dip hot dogs, 1 at a time, into glass of batter to coat (add more batter to glass if necessary), then fry, turning occasionally, until batter is cooked through and golden-brown all over, about 3 minutes. Transfer corn dogs to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350F and refill glass with batter between batches.	10
1311	Roasted Mustard Tarragon Chicken	Slathering mustard on chicken is one easy way to a juicy, flavorful bird. Like its creator, Ruth Cousineau, this dish revels in simplicity without being austere: Gild the lily by making a delectably creamy, mustardy gravy from the pan juices. The gravy, in turn, begs for mashed potatoes, and by adding a saladvoil, the perfect Sunday dinner. (Editor's note: This recipe is solely the creation of Ruth Cousineau and has not been formally tested by the test kitchen.)	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Pull off excess fat around cavities of chicken and discard, then rinse chicken and pat dry. Mix together 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and rub inside cavity. Chop enough tarragon to measure 1 1/2 tablespoons and set aside, then add remainder of bunch to cavity. Put chicken in a flameproof shallow roasting pan or gratin dish and rub all over with 1/3 cup mustard. Tie legs together with string and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into fleshy part of a thigh (do not touch bone) registers 170F, 45 minutes to 1 hour.@newline@Carefully tilt chicken so juices from cavity run into roasting pan, then transfer chicken to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.@newline@Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan. Whisk in flour, then cook over medium heat, whisking, 1 minute. Add water, whisking constantly and scraping up brown bits, and bring to a boil. Simmer sauce until slightly thickened, then whisk in cream, remaining tablespoon mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.@newline@Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids, then stir in reserved chopped tarragon. Serve chicken with sauce.	5
1312	Homemade Ginger Ale	Carefully simmering fresh ginger in water for a good, long while is the key to deep, rounded flavor. Once you have the ginger syrup on hand, a hankering for ginger ale can be satisfied practically instantly (the drink's trademark fizz comes from seltzer). For a more traditional take on this zingy cooler, check out the recipe for pHomemade Ginger Beer	Make syrup: Cook ginger in water in a small saucepan at a low simmer, partially covered, 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 20 minutes.@newline@Strain mixture through a sieve into a bowl, pressing on ginger and then discarding. Return liquid to saucepan and add sugar and a pinch of salt, then heat over medium heat, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Chill syrup in a covered jar until cold.	3
1313	Buttermilk Pudding Cake with Maple Raspberries	As its name suggests, a pudding cake is like two desserts in one: a light, fluffy cake that gives way to a smooth, rich custard. This one gets its signature tang from buttermilk. Maplesweetened berries prove to be an inspired companion.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter a 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.@newline@Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together buttermilk, butter, yolks, and 1/3 cup sugar in a separate bowl, then stir into flour mixture.@newline@Beat egg whites with an electric mixer at medium speed until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and add remaining 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks.@newline@Stir about one third of whites into batter to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Pour batter into baking dish and bake in a water bath until puffed and golden-brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly, 10 to 15 minutes.@newline@Toss raspberries with maple syrup and serve with warm pudding cake.	12
1314	Cardamom Milk Pudding	There are many variations on the Middle Eastern milk pudding known as pmuhallebip, but this one, delicately flavored with cardamom, is especially silky, thanks to arrowroot. It tastes best when served well chilled.	Bring milk, cardamom pods, and a pinch of salt just to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.@newline@Whisk together arrowroot and sugar in a large bowl, then whisk in hot milk mixture. Return to saucepan and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Chill pudding, its surface covered with wax paper, until very cold, at least 4 hours. Serve sprinkled with nuts.	1
1315	Green-Peppercorn Cornmeal Crackers	Cornmeal lends these crackers a golden glow and a nice crunch; lots of crushed green peppercorns (left over from pChicken Spice Rubp ) provide an intriguing spiciness. Serve them with cheese or all on their own with cocktails.	Whisk together flours, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, 2 teaspoons peppercorns, and table salt in a bowl. Blend in butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk and stir just until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead 6 to 8 times.

1346	Farro Spaghetti, Beets, Brown Butter, Poppy Seeds	Recipes from two New York women respected in the food business influenced this dish: In her book pA Fresh Taste of Italy,p Michele Scicolone (once my Brooklyn landlady) offers Spaghetti with Rubies, where the rubies are chunks of roasted beets sauted in olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. At her legendary Brooklyn trattoria Al di L, chef/co-owner Anna Klinger serves ravioli stuffed with beets tossed in brown butter and poppy seeds. Beets, together with poppy seeds, are typical in dishes of the northern Italian regions of Friuli and Alto Adige. With all these factors in mind, I came up with my own combination of pasta with beets and poppy seeds.	1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the beets in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Cover with the olive oil and water. Bake until a tester easily passes through the beets, about 1 1/4 hours. Let cool.@newline@2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.@newline@3.

Use a wire-mesh skimmer or tongs to remove the spaghetti from the pot and place them directly into the skillet with the sauce. Stir to combine.@newline@6. Divide the spaghetti into equal portions and place on warm plates. Use two round or oval soup spoons to form little balls of the goat's milk cheese. Place a ball on top of each serving.@newline@7.

1362	Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi	This recipe, based on Elizabeth David's pGNOCCHI DI RICOTTAp in her book pItalian Foodp, has become one of our most-often-requested house formulas. Requiring fresh, curdy ricotta, it yields succulent, tender dumplings that always beguile. But since fresh ricotta varies in texture, flavor, and moisture content, depending on the season, what the animals are eating, who is making it, and how long they drain it, we often need to tinker with the recipe, adding more Parmigiano-Reggiano for flavor, or butter for richness. If the cheese is particularly wet, we add a little more egg, or we hang it overnight in cheesecloth, refrigerated (or we do both). Very wet ricotta can weep 1/2 cup liquid per pound. Don't substitute machine-packed supermarket ricotta; flavor issues notwithstanding, mechanical packing churns and homogenizes the curds and wateryou'll have trouble getting enough water back out. Tender fresh sheep's milk ricotta, if you can get it, makes delicious gnocchi and is worth the extra expense.p@newline@pHaving offered ricotta gnocchi four or five evenings per week for more than a decade, we have a large repertory of accompaniments for, and variations on, this dish. We sometimes add freshly grated nutmeg, chopped lemon zest, or chopped sage stewed in butter to the batter before forming the gnocchi. Or we form thumbnail-sized gnocchi and poach them in chicken broth for a delicate soup course. One of the nicest variations is to fold flecks of barely cooked spinach into the batter. These Spinach and Ricotta Gnocchi recall the Florentine mainstay, variously called pravioli verdip ("green ravioli"), pignudip ("naked" ravioli), or pmalfattip ("poorly fashioned," which they needn't be), and are sublime.p@newline@pAlthough these gnocchi are delicious and delicate enough to serve with just a cloak of melted butter, I list my favorite seasonal accompaniments at the end of the recipe to provoke you to think of serving ricotta gnocchi often, and year-round.p	Testing the cheese (the day before you make the gnocchi): Check the cheese for wetness. If you are lucky enough to have an individual basket-drained ricottayou'll see the basket imprint or dimples on the cheeseit may be sitting in a little whey; in this case, slide it out of the container and wick away the surface moisture with a dry towel. With any ricotta, place about 2 teaspoons of the cheese on a dry paper towel and wait for about 1 minute. There will always be a little wet spot under and around the cheese, but if the cheese has thrown a wide ring of moisture, it is too wet to use as is. Place it in a strainer, or double-wrap in cheesecloth, and suspend over a deeper receptacle to drain for 8 to 24 hours, refrigerated. Cheesecloth is more efficient, as it also wicks moisture from the cheese while gravity does its job of draining. You can also speed up the draining operation by cinching the cheesecloth tight and squeezing some of the moisture from the ball of cheese.	6

Use a spatula to pull sides of marshmallow from edge of pan, then invert onto cutting board. Dust top with confectioners sugar. Cut marshmallow into 1-inch squares.@newline@Dredge marshmallows in confectioners sugar to coat completely.	3
1383	Lemon Mint Braised Artichokes	As a harbinger of spring, artichokes have a special place on the Passover table and in our hearts. One of Roberts's favorite ways to enjoy them is this elegant Roman preparation. (Rome is home to the oldest Jewish community in the Western worldthe first Jews arrived in 161 b.c.e. as ambassadors from Judah Maccabee in Jerusalem.) The trimmed artichokes are braised in a lemony broth zinging with garlic and mint, which is later reduced to a satiny sauce.	Squeeze 2 lemon halves into a large bowl of cold water.@newline@Cut off top inch of 1 artichoke and bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base (keep stem attached). Discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until you reach pale yellow leaves.@newline@Cut off remaining leaves 1/2 inch above top of artichoke base using a sharp knife, then pull out purple leaves and scoop out fuzzy choke with a melon-ball cutter. Trim dark green fibrous parts from base and side of artichoke.@newline@Trim a thin slice from stem end, then trim side of stem down to pale green inner core. Rub cut surfaces with lemon halves, then put artichokes in lemon water.@newline@Trim remaining artichokes in same manner.@newline@Combine lemon juice, water (3 cups), oil, 3 tablespoons mint, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt in a 4-to 5-quarts heavy pot (wide enough to hold artichokes in 1 layer with stems pointing upward) and bring to a simmer.@newline@Stand artichokes, stem ends up, in liquid and cover with a round of parchment paper. Simmer, covered with parchment and lid, until just tender when artichoke bottom is pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes.@newline@Transfer artichokes with a slotted spoon to a shallow serving dish. Boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. During last 2 minutes of boiling, whisk liquid until it emulsifies. Pour over artichokes and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons mint.	6
1384	Ham and Rice Croquettes	NoDescription	Stir together rice, ham, cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put remaining egg (lightly beaten) and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls.@newline@Heat 1 to 1 1/2 inches oil to 350F in a 10-inch skillet over high heat. Meanwhile, dampen your hands and form 1/4-cup amounts of rice mixture into 2 1/2-inch cakes. Lightly coat with egg, then with bread crumbs. Fry croquettes in 2 batches, turning once or twice, until golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.	10
1385	Rustic French Meatloaf	This comforting dish marries the simplicity of meatloaf with the flavor and depth of a French pt. Leftover slices naturally make terrific sandwiches, but they're also wonderful panfried in olive oil.	Preheat oven to 475F with rack in middle.@newline@Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl.@newline@Cook onion, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly.@newline@Pure livers in a blender, then transfer to a large bowl. Add pork, veal, prunes, pistachios, thyme, eggs, bread-crumb mixture, onion mixture, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and gently mix with your hands until just combined.@newline@Transfer meatloaf mixture to an 81/2- by 41/2-inch glass loaf pan (see cooks' note, below) and bake, covered with foil, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 165F, 50 to 55 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes. Cover top of meatloaf with parsley before slicing.	2
1386	Candied-Fennel-Topped Lemon Cake	Here comes the sun: Topped with graceful fans of candied fennel and bathed in a golden syrup, this lemony upside-down cake is a cheery sight. The fennel's subtle sweetness and beautiful form are quite sophisticated, but the cake's buttermilk crumb is pure homey delight. A cloud of whipped cream makes a fitting accompaniment.	Prepare cake pan: Lightly oil pan and line bottom and side with a large round of wax paper, pleating sides and trimming to fit. Lightly oil paper. Line side with a 2-inch-wide strip of wax paper long enough to wrap around inside of pan to cover pleats, then lightly oil.	1
1387	Green Beans with Celery-Salt Butter	Most people keep celery salt around primarily for Bloody Marys, but its grassy brightness also pairs well with green beans, which offer a counterpoint to the rich flavors of this meal. Like all dried seasonings, celery salt loses flavor over timeif you cant remember how long your jar has been in your pantry, pitch it and buy a new one.	Cook green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 5 quarts water) until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together butter and celery salt. Drain beans, then toss with butter and season with pepper.	1
1388	Golden Potatoes with Caper Brown-Butter Crumbs	These potatoes look like doubloons and taste like a million bucks. The addition of nutty brown butter, briny capers, and toasty homemade bread crumbs makes them a splendid companion to the pork roastor any roasted meat, poultry, or fish, for that matter.	Put a 4-sided sheet pan in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 425F.@newline@Cover potatoes with 2 inches water in a 5-to 6-quart pot and add 1 tablespoon salt. Simmer until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes well.@newline@While potatoes simmer, heat butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in capers. Keep warm, covered.@newline@Toss potatoes with 3 tablespoons caper butter, then spread out in hot sheet pan. Stir remaining caper butter into bread crumbs and scatter over potatoes. Roast, turning potatoes once or twice, until potatoes are tender and crumbs are golden, about 20 minutes. Season with salt.	2
1389	Hot Toddy Pudding Cake	The Hot Toddyfor centuries, the classic remedy for a freezing-cold nightis, writes cocktail historian David Wondrich in Imbibe!, "one of the clearest signs I know that there is a providential plan to the universe." The subtle, malty flavor of good Scotch whisky is carried in this instance by a pudding cake, which separates into two layers as it bakes. Eat this while it's still warm from the oven.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter a 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.@newline@Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together milk, lemon juice, Scotch (if using), butter, honey, zest, and yolks, then stir into flour mixture.@newline@Beat whites with an electric mixer at medium speed until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks.@newline@Stir about one third of whites into flour mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Pour batter into baking dish and bake in a water bath until puffed and golden-brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Serve warm.	10
1390	Sauted Chicory	Despite her pride in her cultural heritage, Miraglia Eriquez says: "I gotta be honest, some Italians are known for cooking vegetables to death, and I like to keep my greens green." So she boils chicory for only a few minutes to tame its bitterness, then sauts it briefly, keeping the leaves fresh and slightly crisp. This simple, light side dish is great with the hearty pragp -coated pasta.	Wash chicory. Cook in an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water), uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well.@newline@Dry pot, then heat oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook garlic with red-pepper flakes, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute.@newline@Add chicory, stirring to coat. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt.	11
1391	Lemon Pepper Acini di Pepe	This small, round pasta is named for its resemblance to peppercorns, so why not pair it with black pepper, which, along with lemon, adds brightness to the parmesan?	Cook acini di pepe in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water (2 teaspoons salt for 3 quart water) until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.@newline@Melt butter in same pot with oil. Remove from heat and stir in pasta, cheese, zest, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup cooking water (add more to moisten if necessary).	6
1392	Spaghetti and Meatballs	A heaping platter of spaghetti and meatballs evokes a feeling of comfortperfect for a family get-together. The stars of this dish are the meatballs, of course, and they don't disappointlots of garlic and Parmigiano-Reggiano give them a robust flavor that stands up to the hearty tomato sauce.	Make sauce: Drain tomatoes, reserving juice in a large bowl. Crush tomatoes with your hands and add to juice.@newline@Cook onions in oil in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, 4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Simmer sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt.	12
1393	Mozzarella	If you live near a deeply rooted Italian community, chances are you have easy access to great fresh mozzarella. If that's not the case, though, it's time to channel your inner artisanal cheesemaker. You'll find that the pure, clean flavor of homemade mozzarella is a revelation, as is the cheese's tender, almost flaky, pull-apart texture. Time, patience, and careful attention to detail are the keys to success.	Heat milk and citric acid to 88F in a 7- to 8-quart heavy pot over low heat, stirring occasionally, then maintain a temperature of 88 to 91F on an instant-read thermometer, returning to and removing from heat as necessary, for 1 hour. (Mixture will begin to curdle.)@newline@Dissolve rennet in warm water, then stir into milk mixture. Let stand, uncovered, maintaining 88 to 91F, until the consistency of soft pudding, 15 to 20 minutes.@newline@Using a long knife, make cuts across stiffened milk mixture at 1/2-inch intervals, reaching down to bottom of pot, then make similar cuts in stiffened milk mixture to form a crosshatch pattern (small squares) on top. Let stand, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Keeping temperature between 88 and 91F (reheat when necessary over very low heat), gently stir curds every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, then let curds stand, uncovered and undisturbed, maintaining temperature, 30 minutes more.@newline@Line a large sieve with cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Using a ladle or slotted spoon, transfer curds to center of cheesecloth. Gather sides up over curds to form a sack and tie sides together with a long piece of string as close to curds as possible but without squeezing curds. Suspend sack from a knob or cupboard handle, using string, at least 4 inches from bottom of bowl (sack should not sit in any whey that accumulates; if necessary, discard whey as it accumulates). Let hang 3 hours at room temperature.@newline@Heat a large pot of heavily salted water (1/3 cup salt for 5 quarts water) to 170F. Place one fourth of the curds in a shallow bowl, then ladle about 6 cups hot water over curds and let stand until curds start to meld together, about 2 minutes. Gather curds together with a slotted spoon and remove from water. Working over the bowl of hot water, gently fold the mass of curds over itself in your hands, stretching as you fold. Reheat in hot water as necessary (3 to 5 times) to maintain temperature, folding and stretching until curds become a smooth and elastic disk.@newline@Form into a ball by tucking outside into center, then pinch edges together. Place mozzarella in cool water to cool completely before eating. Make remaining cheese in same manner, reusing hot salted water for subsequent batches.	4
1394	Almond, Chocolate, and Pistachio Spumoni	Spumoni trumps all others as the ideal frozen treat: It's richer than gelato, lighter than ice cream, and smoother than frozen custard. The inspiration for this classic flavor combination came from L & B Spumoni Gardens, in Brooklyn, a favorite spot for this tricolor treat.	Bring milk to a simmer in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk together yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Whisk in milk, then transfer mixture to saucepan.@newline@Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Immediately strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Divide custard among 3 bowls. To make almond base, whisk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla into 1 bowl; for pistachio base, whisk almond extract and food coloring into another bowl; for chocolate base, whisk cocoa and remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla into third bowl.@newline@Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Chill custards, surfaces covered with parchment paper (to prevent a skin from forming), until cold, at least 6 hours.@newline@Freeze each custard in ice cream maker, 1 batch at a time (white, then green, then brown). Fold almonds into vanilla custard, then fold pistachios into green custard. Transfer to a shallow 2-quart container or 3 smaller containers and put in freezer to firm up, about 4 hours.	2
1395	Broccolini with Italian Herb Oil	A generous drizzle of parsley-oregano oil brings a wave of herbal freshness to slender stalks of simply cooked Broccolini.	Cook Broccolini in a 5-to 6-quarts pot of boiling salted water (2 teaspoons salt for 4 quarts water) until just tender, about 6 minutes, then drain.@newline@Meanwhile, blend herbs, garlic, anchovy paste, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a blender until finely chopped. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream, blending until mixture is green and herbs are very finely chopped.@newline@Serve Broccolini tossed with herb oil.	7
1396	Ricotta Cheesecake	The difference between fresh and commercially prepared ricotta is proven dramatically with this cheesecake. Made with the commercial product, it tastes bland and somewhat grainy. When prepared with fresh ricotta, however, the cake dissolves creamily on the tongue and the ricotta's delicate sweetness shines through clean and true. To further emphasize the ricotta, we keep the other flavors to a minimumjust a smidgen of cinnamon, lemon zest, and vanilla is all you need.	Preheat oven to 325F with rack in lower third.@newline@Lightly butter pan and coat with cookie crumbs, leaving any loose crumbs distributed over bottom of pan.@newline@Whisk together remaining ingredients and pour into crust.@newline@Bake until puffed and golden but center is still slightly wobbly, about 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Cool in pan on a rack (cake will sink a little).@newline@Serve cheesecake warm or at room temperature.	3
1397	Fresh Egg Fettucine	Although this flour, semolina, and egg mixture begins as a stiff dough, it cooks into beautiful, velvety noodles that are as smooth as butter. A pasta machine makes this recipe easy and foolproof. Store-bought fettuccine simply can't compare to homemade.	Make dough: Combine flour and semolina, then mound on a work surface (preferably wooden). Make a well in center and add eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt to well. (Alternatively, put ingredients in a food processor.)@newline@Gradually stir enough flour into eggs (using a fork) to form a paste, pulling in flour closest to egg mixture and being careful not to make an opening in wall of well. Knead remaining flour into mixture with your hands to form a dough (it should be firm and not sticky). Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. (If using a processor, blend about 30 seconds total.)@newline@Cover dough with an inverted bowl and let dough rest 1 hour to make rolling easier.	12
1398	Oranges in Red Wine	The kitchen was the domain of Miraglia Eriquez's grandmother, but this recipe was her grandfather's specialty. Sitting at the dining table, Poppy, as he was known, would peel and cut oranges, toss the pieces into glasses, and cover them with red wine. After the oranges soaked up and sweetened the wine, he would eat forkfuls of the fruit, then down the drink. It wasand isthe perfect prelude to dessert.	Divide oranges among 12 (5-to 8-ounces) juice glasses and top with wine. Let stand 5 minutes.	1
1399	Individual Grape and Vin Santo Cakes	In these tender, elegant cakes, the Italian dessert wine Vin Santo contributes intoxicating flavor that's played up by the addition of plump grapes.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle. Generously butter muffin cups and dust with flour, knocking out excess.@newline@Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.@newline@Beat butter with 2/3 cup granulated sugar using an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in zest.@newline@Add flour mixture in 2 batches alternately with wine, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until just incorporated.@newline@Toss grapes with remaining tablespoon flour, then fold into batter.@newline@Divide batter among muffin cups. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Bake until golden and springy to the touch, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then loosen with a knife and remove. Cool to warm, 5 to 10 minutes more.	8
1400	Tony's Negronis	These cocktails are as much fun to drink as they are to say. Tony Oltranti adds freshly squeezed orange juice to a traditional Italian aperitif and serves it straight up in a chilled Martini glass. pSalutep!	Combine all ingredients with ice in shaker. Shake well and strain into chilled Martini glasses.	4
1401	Inside-Out Eggplant Parmigiana	In the waste-not mentality of Italian pcucina poverap, panfried patties made with eggs and bread crumbs are a great use for leftover eggplant parmigiana ingredients. In fact, the patties are so incredibly delicious that we made them the crisp showstoppers in this fun reconstruction.	Make tomato sauce: Heat oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, blend tomatoes with juice in a blender until almost smooth. Add to onion mixture in saucepan with water, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil and keep warm, covered.	2
1402	Pizza Margherita	The secret to a great pizza Margherita is to use the best ingredients you can findand to approach them with restraint. (Just because a little cheese is good doesn't mean a lot will be better!) We always start with our all-time favorite pizza dough, adapted from chef Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, in Phoenix. This slightly wet dough, in conjunction with a hot pizza stone, produces a crisp yet chewy crust, the perfect canvas for bright homemade tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and verdant basil leaves.	Make dough: Stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl and let stand until surface appears creamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't appear creamy, discard and start over with new yeast.)@newline@Add 1 1/4 cups flour, remaining 1/2 cup water, salt, and oil and stir until smooth. Stir in enough flour (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for dough to begin to pull away from side of bowl. (Dough will be slightly wet.)@newline@Knead on a floured surface, lightly reflouring when dough becomes too sticky, until smooth, soft, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form into a ball, put in a bowl, and dust with flour. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, about 1 1/4 hours.	4
1403	Panettone Bread Pudding	Store-bought panettone is the foundation of this raisin and bread pudding. Because the bread is so eggy, it bakes into an extra-silky custard that contrasts with a generous expanse of buttery golden brown crispness on top. (Using a shallow pan is key.)	Soak raisins in hot brandy 15 minutes, then drain (discard brandy or reserve for making biscotti; recipe follows).@newline@Meanwhile, butter panettone on both sides and cook in batches in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.@newline@Whisk together remaining ingredients.@newline@Tear panettone into bite-size pieces and spread evenly in a buttered 13-by 9-inch baking dish. Scatter raisins over top, then pour in egg mixture. Let stand 30 minutes.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Bake until pudding is golden and just set, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.	1
1404	Sunday Rag	This bottomless bowl of meat sauce is the stuff of dreamsthe American Dream, in particular. In Italy, rag would have been flavored with a small piece of pork, but because meat was so readily available in the United States, immigrants included beef pbraciolep, meatballs, sweet and hot sausage, and pork shoulder and ribs. This dish requires hours on the stovetop to make the meat tender and juicy and the sauce thick and intense, but it's well worth waiting for.	Make tomato sauce: Pulse tomatoes with juice (1 can at a time) in a blender until almost smooth.@newline@Heat oil in a wide 10-to 12-quarts heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then saut onion until golden, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and saut 1 minute.@newline@Add tomato pure, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 40 to 45 minutes. Discard bay leaf.	1
1405	Shaved-Fennel Salad with Oranges and Pecorino	Jazz up your winter repertoire with a tangy, colorful pomegranate dressing that melds fennel and oranges with salty Pecorino	Boil pomegranate juice in a small heavy saucepan until reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 6 minutes.@newline@Transfer to a small bowl or measuring cup and quick-chill in an ice bath.@newline@Meanwhile, cut fennel into paper-thin slices with slicer. Cut peel, including all white pith, from oranges. Cut segments free from membranes and coarsely chop.@newline@Whisk 1/2 teaspoon salt into pomegranate juice, then whisk in oil.@newline@Arrange fennel and oranges on salad plates or put in a large salad bowl. Sprinkle with cheese and drizzle with dressing. Season with pepper.	4
1406	Butternut Squash and Radicchio Pappardelle	Sweet nibbles of butternut squash temper the bitter edge of radicchio in every bite of this healthful, satisfying pasta.	Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, then continue to cook until it is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add oil, then nuts, and cook, stirring, until nuts are golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate.@newline@Add squash to skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add radicchio and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until wilted and just tender, about 3 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, cook pappardelle in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoon salt for 6 quarts water) until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta. Add pasta to radicchio mixture with 1/2 cup cooking water and toss over low heat until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add more cooking water to moisten if necessary.@newline@Serve topped with nuts and cheese.	6
1407	Minted Green Salad	Fresh mint and sliced cucumbers give this American-style salad a lightness that leaves you feeling satisfied, not stuffed.	Halve carrots crosswise, then shave into wide ribbons using a vegetable peeler. Toss with cucumbers, lettuces, mint, and oil in a large bowl.@newline@Sprinkle with sea salt and toss, then sprinkle with vinegar and toss again.	4
1408	Linguine with Pesto Trapanese	NoDescription	Saut the almonds in a little olive oil until tan.@newline@Put basil, garlic, and salt in food processor and chop. Put aside.@newline@Put in almonds and pulse until size of orzo.@newline@Put tomatoes, almonds, basil garlic, cheese, and olive oil back in food processor and whir briefly. Add some fresh-ground coarse pepper.@newline@Boil linguine. If you are Sicilian, become hysterical at the prospect of overcooked pasta. Break open a strand every 60 seconds, and when there is one tiny white speck at the center, drain instantly. Save a cupful of pasta water.@newline@Put pasta in with pesto and mix quickly. Add a little pasta water if necessary. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature.	12
1409	Fried Mozzarella Balls	NoDescription	Heat about 11/2 inches oil to 360F in a 3 1/2-to 4-quart heavy saucepan.@newline@Meanwhile, double-coat bocconcini by dipping in eggs, then in bread crumbs, and repeating. Transfer to a sheet of wax paper.@newline@Working in batches of 10, lower balls into oil with a slotted spoon and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain and season with salt. (Return oil to 360F between batches.)	4
1410	Sweet Ricotta Pastries	In many Italian-American bakeries, these cross-topped pies are tucked among cannoli, biscotti, and pignoli cookies. In this homemade version, ppasta frollap (a tender, short crust) is filled with a creamy orange-scented ricotta custard. Served with hot espresso, these little pastries are a wonderful way to end a big family meal.	Make filling: Bring milk and zest to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan, then remove from heat. Whisk together yolk, sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Whisk in milk, then transfer mixture to saucepan.@newline@Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, and boil 1 minute. Stir in vanilla, then transfer to a clean bowl and chill custard, its surface covered with parchment paper (to prevent a skin from forming), until cold, at least 1 hour. Discard zest.@newline@Pulse ricotta in a food processor until smooth. Whisk into custard. Stir in orange-flower water and citron. Chill until ready to use.	3
1411	Grilled Jerk Chicken with Scotch Bonnet Sauce and Mango Chutney	This version of the famous jerk method from Boston Bay in Jamaica is a classic example of why spice pastes work so well in grilling: They're easier to make and impart flavors more directly than a liquid marinade. Sweet-and-sour chutney and an incendiary but hyper-flavorful Scotch bonnet pepper sauce complement the chicken. You probably won't use all the sauce, but extra keeps, covered and refrigerated, indefinitely.p	In blender or food processor, pure oil, chiles, scallions, thyme, dry mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth. Arrange chicken in large glass baking dish and coat on all sides with paste. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.	8
1412	Cumin-Crusted Monster Pork Chop with Peach Chipotle Salsa	This Latin-inspired combination of flavors works well with smoky grilled pork, and the crispy cumin crust is complemented by both the heat and sweetness in the salsa. These thick-cut chops taste just as good cold  if there are any left.	Make salsa In medium bowl, toss together all ingredients. Transfer to serving dish and set aside.	10
1413	Grilled Short Ribs with Miso	Look for flanken-style ribs  cut thinly and across the bones, rather than between the bones. You'll find them at Korean markets, or ask a butcher to cut them for you.	Whisk soy sauce, sugar, garlic, and oil in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. DO AHEAD Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Add ribs to marinade; turn to coat. Let marinate 30 minutes at room temperature, turning occasionally.@newline@Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill with oil. Grill ribs until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove meat from bones and wrap in lettuce leaves with small amount of miso and Sticky Rice.	6
1414	Coeur  la Crme	This classic, heart-shaped dessert is basically a no-bake, crustless cheesecake.p	Rinse cheesecloth under water; squeeze until just damp. Line each of four 3- to 4-inch coeur  la crme molds with 1 square of cheesecloth. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, crme frache, 4 tablespoons powdered sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in large bowl until smooth, about 4 minutes. Press through fine strainer; divide among molds. Fold cheesecloth over. Place molds in shallow baking dish; cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.@newline@Stir strawberries with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar; let stand 30 minutes. Unwrap molds; invert onto plates. Spoon strawberries around and serve.	6
1415	Strawberry and Blueberry Summer Pudding	A simple, traditional British dessert that combines fresh berries, buttered bread, and a little sugar  and it couldn't be more delicious. Start the recipe at least 12 hours ahead.	Place strawberries, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in large bowl. Mash to coarse pure.

1416	Panko Pork Cutlets with Pineapple and Ginger Salsa	This Caribbean-style pork dish is by cookbook author Daisy Martinez. Look for panko in the Asian foods section of the supermarket or at Asian markets.	Stir pineapple cubes, sugar, minced ginger, and 3/4 cup water in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture comes to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until pineapple is soft, stirring often and adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if dry, about 30 minutes. Stir in white wine vinegar.

1423	Veal Rolls Stuffed with Spinach and Gruyre	We're all for those simple dishes in which every ingredient tastes radiantly of itself. Sometimes, though, we're reminded of how ingredients can become even more special from their interaction. This veal preparation is definitely one of those reminders  you don't taste cheese or anchovy or wine or butter, just gorgeous meat with a green freshness from the spinach. You'll want some good crusty bread to soak up every last drop of the incredibly flavorful sauce.	Mash anchovy paste into 4 tablespoons butter in a bowl until combined. Gently pound cutlets to slightly less than 1/8 inch thick between 2 sheets of plastic wrap with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin. Pat cutlets dry and season lightly with salt and pepper, then spread 1 1/2 teaspoons anchovy butter over top of each cutlet. (You will have a little butter left over.) Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese over anchovy butter, leaving a 1/4-inch border, then arrange spinach leaves, overlapping in 1 layer, to cover cutlets. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, arrange with a short side nearest you and roll up tightly, then secure with a wooden pick.@newline@Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425F.@newline@Pat rolls dry.

Fry meatballs, turning gently with tongs or a slotted spoon, until deep golden on all sides, about 5 minutes total (if meatballs stick to wok, add more oil). Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then arrange on top of cabbage in pot. Add broth, then cover meatballs completely with reserved 4 cabbage leaves. Bring liquid just to a boil, then reduce heat and gently simmer, covered, 1 hour. (Check occasionally to be sure liquid is not boiling vigorously.) Season broth with salt, then move large cabbage leaves around side of pot to resemble a lion's mane. Serve in individual shallow bowls.	4
1425	Appenzeller Cheese Crisps	These lacy, savory, funnel-cake-like squiggles, made with the mild Swiss cheese known as Appenzeller, are unbelievably light because of the carbonation of the beer in the batter.

1467	Chocolate ChipOrange Cannoli (Cannoli di Ricotta)	There are several secrets to perfect, crisp cannoli:p@newline@p1). You need the right proportion of filling to shell. In America, cannoli are often too large, with too much filling. These are tiny and delicate, perfect for eating in just a couple of bites.p@newline@p2). Use high-quality ingredients. Sheep's-milk ricotta is the most traditional, but good fresh cow's-milk ricotta will work fine as well. Be sure to drain it for an hour to avoid watering down the filling. Good-quality candied orange peel is important as well. If you can't find any that's fresh and plump, substitute freshly grated orange zest.p@newline@p3). Most importantly, don't fill the shells until you're ready to serve them. Both the filling and the shells can be made one day ahead, but to avoid soggy shells, don't pipe the filling into them until the last minute.p	Make dough In medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon. Using fingertips or pastry blender, blend in butter just until mixture resembles coarse meal. (Alternatively, pulse in food processor.)

1509	Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken	My uncle Roger Glenn is known for his terrific fried chicken, which we look forward to eating all year. We count on him to bring a loaded basket of his impossibly crisp specialty to our homecoming reunion held annually on the shaded grounds next to the Elderville cemetery, where many of our relatives are buried. But Roger Glenn didn't show up last year, and we were just a touch put out.p@newline@p"We tell 'em we don't care if he comes, we just want his chicken," says Cousin Vera. But Roger got the dates mixed up and scheduled some sorry old hunting trip instead, so we all had to suffer.p@newline@pRoger's chicken is so good that Vera and her sisters Barbara and Gloria always toss one of his chicken legs over the fence and onto the grave of their dear deceased brother Vance Mitchell, who died eight years ago. Before his death, Vance made it known that even after he was gone, he just might crave another bite of chicken. Every year his sisters make sure that he gets one. Always one to think ahead, Cousin Vance also carefully selected his future gravesite.p@newline@p"Vance said, 'I want mine right here, near the barbecue pit, where all the food is going to be,'" recalls Vera.p	Combine the buttermilk, thyme, Tabasco, Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pepper in a nonreactive bowl large enough to contain all of the chicken pieces with at least 1 inch to spare. Add the chicken and turn to coat fully in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before frying.@newline@Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a large, shallow bowl, combine the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, Cajun seasoning, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and roll it around in the seasoned flour until completely covered. Set it on the prepared baking sheet; repeat with the remaining chicken. Dip the coated chicken pieces once more in the marinade, then again in flour. Return the pieces to the baking sheet (a few minutes' rest makes for a sturdier, crisper coating).@newline@Have a wire cooling rack set over paper towels ready. In a large, heavy Dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 inches of oil over medium heat until it reaches 350F on a deep-fat thermometer. Using kitchen tongs, add a few chicken pieces at a time to the hot oil (crowding will lower the temperature, making for greasy chicken). Fry the chicken until the internal temperature reaches 180F, about 10 minutes per side (watch carefully, it can easily burn). Transfer the cooked chicken to the wire rack. Serve immediately or at room temperature (don't let the chicken sit more than 2 hours).	5
1510	Grilled Corn with Lime-Cilantro Butter	Sweet summer corn is the best. You can make variations of the cilantro butter with different herbs and use lemon juice.

Grill the corn on a medium-hot grill for 10 minutes, turning occasionally.@newline@3. Transfer the lime-cilantro butter to a serving bowl and serve with the corn.	9
1511	Farmstand Tomato Soup with Arugula Pesto	I love coming home with friends from a steamy day at the beach knowing that I've got a batch of cold tomato soup ready. I dish it up, swirl in a tablespoon of vibrant green arugula pesto, and pass it around. We sit on the porch and savor the flavor of sun-sweetened summer tomatoes enhanced with a touch of cream and a nip of vodka. The rest of dinner will come later, but for now, we're assuaging our hunger, chatting, laughing, and reliving the events of the day.p	To Make the Soup: Preheat the oven to 400F. Set the cored tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and roast them until they look wrinkly, about 30 minutes; set aside. While the tomatoes cool, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small saut pan. Add the shallots and 2 cloves chopped garlic and saut over medium-low heat until they turn golden brown and caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes; set aside.@newline@When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins, which should slip off easily. Put the peeled tomatoes in the jar of a blender along with the sauted shallots and garlic, crushed tomatoes (with juice), 1 tablespoon salt, and sugar. Process until the soup is smooth. Stir in the cream and vodka, if desired. Refrigerate in a covered bowl for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight.	2
1512	White Balsamic-Jicama Slaw	Summer at the beach is unthinkable without coleslaw, but sometimes I hanker for something a bit out of the ordinary. I combined napa cabbage, a more delicate cousin to regular cabbage, with crunchy jicama, dressed it with white balsamic vinegar and mayo, and sprinkled on fennel seed to create what has become my new summer fave. This sturdy salad travels with ease, whether you're taking it to the beach or to a summer party with friends. Another plus: you can make it up to 24 hours in advance.	To Make the Salad: Trim off the cabbage's root end, thinly slice crosswise, then chop into pieces that can be easily picked up with a fork. Combine the cabbage, carrots, jicama, green onions, apples, and dried currants in a large bowl.	8
1513	Mussels with Garam Masala	With the coconut milk left over from our pSweetPotato Coconut Purep , try this very modern spin on steamed mussels. Fennel and tomatoes are common pairings with mussels, but garam masala is the wild card here, contributing an unexpected depth of curry flavor to the coconutmilk broth and tender mussels.	Heat oil in an 8-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook onion, fennel, garlic, garam masala, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, stirring occasionally, until onion and fennel are tender, 12 to 15 minutes.@newline@Add tomatoes with juice and coconut milk and bring just to a boil. Add mussels and cook over medium-high heat, covered, stirring occasionally, just until mussels open wide, 8 to 10 minutes. (Discard any that remain unopened after 10 minutes.)@newline@Chop about 2 tablespoons reserved fennel fronds and stir into mussels along with basil.	10
1514	Potato Samosa Phyllo Triangles	Get the irresistible flavor of samosas without all the frying. Phyllo (left over from pRoasted Winter Vegetable Baklavap ) makes an ingenious wrapper for our take on the popular Indian snacks, although the filling of garammasalaspiced potatoes and peas is quite traditional. They bake up light and crisp, ready for a dip in chutney or raita. Serve these samosas with a salad for a vegetarian main course, or make smaller ones as appetizers.	Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Put in a medium saucepan with 1 teaspoon salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Simmer until tender, about 15 minutes, then drain in a colander.@newline@Cook onion, spices, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add potatoes and peas and cook, stirring, 3 minutes, then remove from heat and cool slightly.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with racks in upper and lower thirds.@newline@Cover stack of phyllo sheets with plastic wrap and a damp kitchen towel. Keeping remaining phyllo covered and working quickly, place 1 sheet on work surface. Gently brush with some butter, then lay a second sheet on top and brush with butter. Cut crosswise into 4 strips. Put 2 tablespoons filling near one corner of 1 strip and fold corner of phyllo over to enclose filling and form a triangle. Continue folding strip, maintaining triangle shape. Put samosa, seam side down, on baking sheet. Make 3 more triangles in same manner. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling. Generously brush both sides of each samosa with butter and bake, turning samosas over halfway through and switching position of sheets, until golden and crisp all over, about 25 minutes total. Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.	8
1515	Pumpkin Potato Puree	This side dish of silky mashed potatoes sweetened with pumpkin (left over from pPumpkin Muffinsp ), seasoned with fresh sage, and laced with melty strands of Fontina cheese is full of favorite autumnal flavors. But, surprisingly, it's the cider vinegar that really makes this dish singjust a tablespoon of this stealth ingredient adds a roundness that ties the whole dish together. We love it with pork chops or turkey cutlets.	Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces, then put in a 3-quart saucepan with 2 teaspoon salt and enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 15 minutes.@newline@Drain potatoes, then return to pot. Add butter and mash with a potato masher. Stir in pumpkin, warm milk, cheese, sage, vinegar, nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.	2
1516	Chicken and Celery Pot Stickers	Traditional pot stickers, complete with fresh dough and the requisite number of pleats, are best saved for a special occasion. This version, made with storebought wonton wrappers, is easy enough for a weeknight meal. A flavorful filling of ground chicken and celery (left over from Sage Stuffing) is seasoned with sesame oil and soy sauce and enclosed within the simply folded wontonno pleats involved. We do cook the pot stickers the conventional way, by first frying them and then steaming them until the water evaporates and the bottoms are crisp and golden. It is imperative to use dark chicken meat (from legs and thighs) because it doesn't dry out the way leaner white meat can.	Make filling: Cut celery into 2-inch pieces. With food processor running, drop in celery and garlic and finely chop. Stop motor and add chicken, 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1/8 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Pulse until just combined.	1
1517	Winter Vegetable Soup	Don't let the 1/2 cup of peas left over from pLatinStyle Chicken and Ricep languish in your freezer. Whip up a batch of this comfortingand easyvegetarian soup. Pureing a small amount of the soup thickens the broth just enough to make it rich and velvety. A lastminute sprinkling of chopped dill underscores the soup's fresh flavor.	Cook onion with bay leaf and 1/2 teaspoon salt in oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add carrot and celery and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes.@newline@Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute, then add sweet potato, Yukon Golds, broth, water, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Pure 1 cup soup in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids) and return to pot. Bring to a simmer, then stir in peas and dill and cook until peas are heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.	2
1518	Turkey and Apricot Meatloaf	Possibly the most delicious turkey meatloaf we've come up with, this one is incredibly moist (dark turkey meat is key). Apricots show up three waysin the finely chopped dried fruit (left over from our pPrune, Cherry, and Apricot Frangipane Tartp ) threaded through the meat, in the apricot preserves that help season it, and in the glaze brushed over the topbut the final result is not cloying, thanks to the healthy dose of ancho chile powder, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, which balances the fruitiness with savory depth. This meatloaf also makes terrific sandwiches, so hope for leftovers.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Soak bread crumbs in milk in a large bowl.@newline@Meanwhile, cook celery, carrot, onion, and garlic with chile powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add to bread-crumb mixture with turkey, dried apricots, parsley, 1 tablespoon preserves, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, eggs, 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and mix with your hands until just combined. Form into a 9- by 5-inch oval loaf (mixture will spread slightly) in a 13- by 9-inch shallow baking dish.@newline@Stir together water, remaining 2 tablespoons preserves, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce and brush over surface of meatloaf. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 165F, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.	3
1519	Onion Anchovy Galette	A take on the Provenal tart known as pissaladire, this galette can be served as an hors d'oeuvre or, with a salad, as a light lunch. It gets fullness of flavor from a tangle of sweet caramelized onions that tops a smear of tomato paste enlivened with garlic and anchovies (left over from Mediterranean Eggplant Relish). A flaky homemade pastry crust ups the richness even more.	Make dough: Blend together flour, butter, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps.@newline@Drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse in processor) until incorporated.@newline@Squeeze a small handful: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated, then test again. (Do not overwork mixture or pastry will be tough.)@newline@Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat.

1520	Tuscan Turkey Soupy Noodles	Turkey soup may be the end of the line for turkey leftovers, but it doesn't have to be boring and predictable. The hearty essence of the roasted holiday bird is concentrated into a deeply satisfying broth, thick with noodles and laced with garlic, rosemary, and tomatoes. This is a guaranteed crowd pleaser whether it's just the family or a last minute gathering of friends. And thanks to the ready availability of turkey wings, executive food editor Kemp M. Minifie bets you won't want to wait until next Thanksgiving to make it again.	Break down carcass into smaller pieces. Simmer carcass, water, reserved leek greens, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 7- to 10-quart heavy pot, uncovered, skimming froth, 3 hours.@newline@Discard large bones with a slotted spoon or tongs, then strain stock through a large sieve into a large bowl (discard solids).@newline@If stock measures less than 10 cups, add water. If it measures more, boil until reduced.@newline@If using stock right away, let stand until fat rises to top, 1 to 2 minutes, then skim off and discard fat. If not, chill (covered once cool) before removing fat. (It will be easier to remove when cool or cold.)@newline@Cook garlic in oil in cleaned pot over medium heat, stirring, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 5 to 8 minutes.

1521	Ginger Scallion Egg-Drop Soup	It's only natural to use leftover chicken broth (from pBlade Steaks with Rosemary WhiteBean Purep ) to make chicken soup. But what a soup! Steeping ginger and scallion greens in the stock and then poaching the chicken in it is a quick way to achieve a depth of flavor. The final soup is enriched with silky ribbons of justcooked eggs, shreds of tender chicken, and fresh rings of scallion. Best of all, this satisfying soup is easy enough to pull together after work.	Smash 3 scallions and cut into 2-inch pieces, then put in a 2-quart saucepan with water, broth, ginger, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, then poach chicken at a bare simmer, uncovered, until just cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let broth steep, covered, 10 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, chop remaining 3 scallions and shred chicken.@newline@Discard scallions and ginger from broth and bring to a brisk simmer. Add beaten eggs in a slow stream, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in scallions, chicken, and white pepper (if using). Serve drizzled with sesame oil.	10
1522	Banana Upside-Down Cake	Bananas, brown sugar, and rum have a natural affinity for each other (think of their shared tropical background), so it's no surprise that they make a wonderful crown for this homespun dessert. The spicy rum flavors of the topping are echoed in the cake itself, making the whole production darker and more interesting than your usual pineapple upsidedown affair. Be sure to use justripe bananas for this recipe; if you use overly ripe ones, they will dissolve into the cake.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Melt butter in skillet over medium heat, then stir in brown sugar, rum, and a pinch of salt and simmer, stirring, 4 minutes. Remove from heat and arrange bananas on top of sugar mixture in concentric circles, fitting in as many pieces as possible.@newline@Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.

Invert a plate over skillet and invert cake onto plate (keeping plate and skillet firmly pressed together). Replace any banana stuck to bottom of skillet.@newline@Serve cake slightly warm or at room temperature.	3
1523	Provenal Braised Lamb Chops	It might seem like a joke to include a recipe designed to use up leftover white wine (from our pRoast Turkey with Black Truffle Butter and WhiteWine Gravyp )after all, why not just drink it?but if you take the time to make this marvelous onedish lamb dinner, you might find yourself hoarding halfempty bottles so you can make it again and again. Lamb shoulder chops are an inexpensive cut that benefits from braising, and the wine really helps tenderize the connective tissues running through the flavorful meat. Snuggling the lamb between sheets of thinly sliced potatoes, plus scatterings of golden garlic, onions, and thyme sprigs, creates a handsome and wonderfully aromatic dish.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Pat chops dry and season with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total). Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook garlic, stirring constantly, until golden, about 1 minute. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate. Brown chops in 2 batches, turning once, about 4 minutes total per batch. Transfer to a plate.@newline@Add onions, bay leaf, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

Repeat layering remaining potatoes and onions, then pour wine, broth, and meat juices over top.@newline@Bake, uncovered, basting top with juices once or twice, until potatoes are tender and browned on top and meat is tender when pierced with tip of a knife, about 1 1/2 hours.	1
1524	Frozen Peanut Butter Pie with Candied Bacon	Candied bacon might seem like the ultimate example of gilding the lily, but it adds a sweet, smoky edge to this already luscious pie. Elvis would be proud.	Cook bacon (in 2 batches if necessary) in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, turning once, until lightly browned on edges but still flexible, 5 to 6 minutes total per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain.@newline@Pour off fat from skillet and arrange bacon in skillet in 1 layer. Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon over bacon and cook over low heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until sugar has dissolved and then caramelized (sugar melts very slowly and burns easily; reduce heat if necessary after sugar begins to caramelize) and coats bacon, 8 to 10 minutes. (Bacon will be dark and look lacquered.) Transfer bacon with tongs to a cutting board to cool. When bacon is cool, finely chop 5 slices, leaving remaining 2 slices whole.@newline@Stir together wafer crumbs and butter, then press onto bottom and up side of pie plate. Chill pie shell.@newline@Heat remaining 1/2 cup sugar and milk in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved.

1525	Baked Apples with Candied Fennel and Pistachios	In our pEgg Salad with Lemon and Fennelp , fennel contributes juicy crunch and a nice hit of bright flavor. Here, the leftover fennel goes in a decidedly different direction: Candied in a sugar syrup, it has a softer snap and becomes more mellow. Along with pistachios, golden raisins, and fennel seeds, it makes a sophisticated filling for baked Gala apples. Many bakedapple recipes are too homey for company, but this version, with its spectrum of greens and golds, would be the highlight of any dinner party menu.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Cover fennel with cold water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, then drain. Return fennel to saucepan and stir in sugar, water (3/4 cup), zest, and fennel seeds. Gently simmer, uncovered, until fennel is tender and translucent and liquid is syrupy, about 45 minutes.

1528	Lemon Sabayon with Grapefruit	This remarkable sabayon, made with egg yolks left over from pSpicedPumpkin Souffls with Bourbon Molasses Saucep , tastes like a very lush and airy lemon curd.

1530	Fruit Salad with Herb, Citrus, Mint-Maple, or Basic Syrup	When I was growing up, my mom would cut up fresh fruit and arrange it on a plate with a shot glass full of toothpicks. She would also toss fresh fruit with some orange or lime juice and sugar. Taking inspiration from her, I came up with my own version: lime, lemon, a little maple syrup, and an herb syrup with rosemary or mint.p	Combine all the fruit in a large bowl and stir in one of the syrups.

1547	Arugula and Goat Cheese Ravioli	Homemade ravioli are well worth the effort, and making them is the perfect task to share with a kitchen full of cooks (even novices can get in on the fun). Mixing the pasta dough is a breeze in the food processor, but if you don't have one, don't worry  we've given the method for making the dough by hand as well. A brown-butter pine-nut sauce is light enough to let your efforts on the pasta really shine through.	To make pasta dough in a food processor: Blend together all dough ingredients in processor until mixture just begins to form a ball. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface, incorporating only as much additional flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes.

1561	Memphis-Style Barbecued Pork Ribs	Pat: Our first taste of national recognition came in 1997, when our pork ribs were voted "the best ribs in Memphis" by the local media. After the votes were cast, the Today show came calling. Tony and I wound up being featured on a segment with Al Roker. Al's enthusiasm for our cooking made others take noticeit was a big moment. It's important to note that we did not become rib masters overnight. It took time to learn the appropriate techniques. Tender, slow-cooked spare ribs require a certain amount of skill and experience. We got ours, and now we are going to give you yours.p	Rinse the rib slabs in cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Place the slabs on a clean chopping board. Using your fingers, pull off the thick white membrane. Use a small knife to trim off the excess fat and meat. Using a sharp knife, trim off the brisket bone. Season both sides of the slab with salt and Neely's Barbecue Seasoning, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to a day in advance.@newline@When you're ready to cook the ribs, preheat the grill to 250F, preferably using a combination of hickory wood and charcoal. Place the slab on the grill away from (not directly over) the flame (using indirect heat). Cook the slab curl-side up for approximately 2 1/2 hours. Flip the slab over to finish the cooking, about 1 more hour, or until you get the full "bend" in the slab (see Tony's Tip).@newline@For dry ribs, pull the ribs off the grill, and sprinkle more Neely's Barbecue Seasoning over the entire slab. Cut between the bones and serve. For wet ribs, pull the ribs off the grill, and pour Neely's Barbecue Sauce over the slab. Slice between the bones into individual portions, and serve.	7

1566	Fabric-Covered Vase Centerpiece	Alison Hotchkiss of San Franciscobased Alison Events shared this easy centerpiece idea with Epicurious. She recommends lining the vases up along the length of your table to create a unique centerpiece. Best of all, after the party, each guest can take home a vase as a memento. The vases shown here are covered in vintage-inspired fabric and were originally part of p1960s-themed bridal shower,p but they can be adapted for any type of party.p@newline@pWhen choosing your fabric, note that a heavier cloth is less likely to show glue through itlook for sturdier materials such as refined burlap, silk dupioni, duck cotton, or heavy polyester. Hotchkiss also recommends using fabric that has printing on both sides; if it's only printed on one side, the blank side may show through the glass. We've allotted enough fabric that you can order an extra vase in each size for practicing.p	Cut fabric into 1-yard and -yard sections.

1577	Mini Rack of Lamb with Nutty Beluga Lentils and Sauted Garlic Spinach	The three main elements in this recipe make an unbeatable combination. The soft, sweet taste of the lamb coupled with full green flavor of the spinach and the nutty, full-bodied taste of the lentils makes every bite a gastronomic pleasure. These lentils are one of my favorites. I've interpreted a recipe from the masterful chef Judy Rodgers of San Francisco's Zuni Caf.	Preheat the oven to 375 F.@newline@In a medium saut pan place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and heat for a minute over medium heat.

Increase the heat and add the red wine. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring, until the mixture becomes dry. Meanwhile, in a saucepan bring the chicken stock to a simmer, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm. Add the warm chicken stock to the lentils (like cooking risotto) 1/2 a cup at a time, letting the lentils absorb the liquid with each addition. Repeat, stirring the mixture constantly. After 28 to 30 minutes the lentils should be slightly chewy and tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.@newline@While the lentils are cooking, rinse and pat the lamb dry and rub it with a tablespoon of olive oil.

1578	Onion Soup with Loads of Thyme and Giant Gruyre Crostini	Whenever the weather begins to get cold, I begin to fantasize about that perfect bowl of French onion soup. The top is golden and crisp, the cheese has blistered and fallen and is completely melted, and gooey bits are stuck to the outer sides of the bowl. When I cut through the cheese, the bread is slightly crisp, but mushy at the same time. I fill my spoon with the rich, full broth crammed with soft, sweet, smoky onions. Here's my fantasy in a bowl.	In a heavy 5-quart pot melt the butter over low heat. Add the onions, thyme, bay leaf, and salt and pepper to taste and cook until the onions are deep amber and exceedingly soft, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the wine, increase the heat, and let the wine bubble away for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beef stock and water, and let the soup simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.@newline@Preheat the oven to broil. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven.@newline@Place the ciabatta on the middle rack of the oven and toast until crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.@newline@Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs from the soup and discard. Pour the soup into two ovenproof bowls, float the toasted ciabatta on top, and cover it with a thick layer of the Gruyre. Put the soup bowls under the broiler on the middle rack and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and golden.	12
1579	Orecchiette	Protein-rich garbanzo flour can be found at health-food grocers (such as Whole Foods).	1. Boil a large pot of salted water.@newline@2.

1586	Braised Brisket with Thirty-Six Cloves of Garlic	In my take on the French classic, chicken with forty cloves of garlic becomes brisket with thirty-six cloves. All that feisty garlic turns sweet and mellow with gentle braising; when pureed, it forms a seductive gravy, which is finished with a zing of chopped raw garlic and lemon zest.p	Preheat the oven to 325F.@newline@Drop the garlic cloves into a small saucepan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain immediately. Peel as soon as the garlic is cool enough to handle. Set aside on paper towels to dry.@newline@Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed roasting pan or casserole large enough to accommodate the meat in one layer. Use two burners, if necessary. Add the brisket and brown well on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a platter and set aside. (Or brown the meat under the broiler: place the brisket, fat side up, on a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler. Broil for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, until browned. Don't allow it to develop a hard, dark crust, which might make the meat tough or bitter. Move the meat around as necessary, so it sears evenly.)@newline@Pour off all but about 1 tablespoon of fat remaining in the pan and add the garlic cloves. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic edges are tinged with gold. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add the stock, thyme, and rosemary sprigs, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Salt and pepper the brisket to taste on all sides, and add it to the pan, fat side up. Spoon the garlic cloves over the meat.@newline@Place the brisket in the oven, cover (if you have no lid, use heavy-duty foil), and cook, basting every half-hour, until the meat is fork tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours or longer. (As the meat cooks, periodically check that the liquid is bubbling gently. If it is boiling rapidly, turn the oven down to 300F.)@newline@The brisket tastes best if it is allowed to rest, reabsorbing the juices lost during braising, and it's easiest to defat the gravy if you prepare the meat ahead and refrigerate it until the fat solidifies. That is the method I use, given here, but the gravy can be prepared by skimming the fat in the traditional way, if you prefer. If you go that route though, do let the meat rest in the pan sauce for at least an hour.@newline@Cool the brisket in the pan sauce, cover well with foil, and refrigerate until the fat congeals. Scrape off all solid fat. Remove the brisket from the pan and slice thinly across the grain.	7
1587	Hungarian Chocolate-Walnut Torte	This is a taste of prewar Hungary, from the family repertoire of my dear friend, Judy Abrams, gifted teacher and poet. Based on ground walnuts and leavened only with eggs, this light, fudge-luscious cake has not a jot of butter or flour, making it Passover-perfect for meat or dairy meals.p@newline@pTo conclude a meat meal, it is delectable plain or dusted fancifully with confectioners' sugar (a Passover recipe without cornstarch below) or glazed with a simple chocolate icing.p@newline@pFor a dairy dish, cover the torte in swirls of lightly sweetened whipped cream or serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side, accompanied by a steaming cup of strong cappuccino.p@newline@pEnjoy this beautifully moist and virtually no-fail torte not just on Passover, but year round. When well wrapped (without icing), it keeps very well, tasting even better a day or two after it is made.p	Have all ingredients at room temperature.@newline@Line the bottom of an 8-inch square cake pan or a 9-inch springform pan with parchment or wax paper.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@In a heavy-bottomed 2-or 3-quart saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly over medium heat. Continue boiling and stirring until all the grains of sugar have completely dissolved and the mixture forms a simple syrup. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chocolate until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool.@newline@In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer until light and thickened, about 4 minutes. Grind the walnuts with the remaining sugar and the matzoh meal in a food processor using the pulse motion and stir into the egg yolks. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and combine thoroughly.@newline@Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites in another bowl until they hold stiff peaks. Gradually fold the whites into the chocolate-walnut mixture, incorporating them gently but thoroughly so that no whites are visible. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until puffed and almost set but still a little gooey in the center. A wooden toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge should come out clean.@newline@Remove the pan from the oven and let cool on a rack. When completely cool, unmold the cake by running a thin-bladed knife around the edges of the cake to release it from the pan (or release the springform); invert onto a platter. Peel off the parchment paper. Serve the torte at room temperature.@newline@If desired, lightly dust with Passover confectioners' sugar. For a lovely, simple presentation, place a doily or a stencilhandmade by you or, even better, your childrenover the torte, then sprinkle with the sugar. Carefully remove the doily or stencil.@newline@Or glaze with the chocolate icing. Lay long strips of wax paper or foil on a cake plate or serving platter and place the cake on top. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Using a spatula, evenly spread the glaze over the top and sides. Now, pull out and discard the paper strips or foil strips--the plate will be clean and ready for serving. If you'd like, garnish with a few walnut halves attractively placed in the center of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for about an hour to set the glaze, but bring it to room temperature before serving.@newline@The plain or frosted torte is heavenly with generous dollops of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.	11

She was especially delighted because sharing a bread starter was a long-standing custom in a small village near Ragusa, Sicily, where she grew up. She said that her mother, at the end of baking day, always passed some of her unbaked bread dough to her friends.

1663	Goldies	Goldies, my organic twist on a Twinkie, have become one of my most notorious treats. I like to bake these with the pEasiest Chocolate Cakep as a base, as it's the perfect partner to the sweet, creamy filling and dark, almost pBittersweet Chocolate Ganachep . For a chic finish, I brush them with gold metallic dust.p	Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray 2 clair pans with organic cooking spray and dust them with cocoa powder; set aside. Fit a small pastry bag with a size-12 tip and set aside.@newline@Using a ladle, fill each prepared clair mold two-thirds full with cake batter. Bake for exactly 18 minutes.

1664	Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting	My son's teachers beg me to make this cake for his snack day at school. It isn't too sweet, and it has a moist, dense texture from the carrots and pineapple. It's also one of my most popular cakes at weddings and parties. When I make it at home, I throw more things into the batterfor example, a handful of pumpkin seeds or toasted pecans if I have them lying around. The beauty of this recipe is that you can increase the spices or omit the nuts, and it will still taste great.	Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper (to ensure that the cake will not stick), or place liners in 2 muffin pans for 24 cupcakes. Set aside.@newline@Place the dried coconut in a cup of warm water to soften and set it aside for 15 minutes.@newline@Place the carrots in a food processor and pulse on and off for 1 minute.

When the batter is almost mixed, stir in the additions, if using. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.@newline@Bake for 55 minutes, or until the tops are a very golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. (It may look as if the cake is too well done, but it takes a while to bake because it's so dense.) For cupcakes, the baking time is 35 to 40 minutes.@newline@Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then invert them onto a wire rack and let them cool completely.@newline@Fill and frost the cake with the Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting (for added oomph, add 1/2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger to the frosting).	2
1665	Chocolate Chip Cookies/Cookie Sandwiches	In my house, baking cookies was a cutthroat competition among siblings, with my mother presiding, Iron Chef style, with one baby perched on her hip and the other clamped to her knee. Our approaches varied. Mary increased the sugar in an attempt to up the crunch. Patrick (ever the psycho perfectionist) altered the recipe and portion size teaspoon by teaspoon in pursuit of a product with Mom's thin and crispy edges. Bill made his backwards, just to act rad. It was never my intention to upstage your cookies, Mombut you should know that I've never claimed a victory as great as when you tasted your first Babycakes NYC cookie and said: "These are better than mine." Slather an exceedingly generous dollop of your pfavorite frostingp between two of these cookies and you've got your newest addiction, the Babycakes NYC cookie sandwich. Try freezing them.	Preheat the oven the 325F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.@newline@In a medium bowl, mix together the oil, applesauce, salt, vanilla, and evaporated cane juice. In another medium bowl, whisk together the flour, flax meal, baking soda and xanthan gum. Using a rubber spatula, carefully add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until a grainy dough is formed. Gently fold in the chocolate chips just until they are evenly distributed through the dough.@newline@Using a melon baller, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing the portions 1 inch apart. Gently press each with the heel of your hand to help them spread. Bake the cookies on the center rack for 15 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees after 9 minutes. The finished cookies will be crisp on the edges and soft in the center.@newline@Let the cookies stand on the sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack and cool completely before covering. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.	2
1666	Vanilla Cupcakes	The recipe that started it all. After five thousand or so failed attempts to produce a vegan, gluten-free cupcake in my slanted, 6foot-by-5inch kitchen in Brooklynwith an oven that flared to broil at whim and had long since lost its temperature dialI had to tape a picture of a cupcake on the fridge to remember what a cupcake should look like. When I finally hit the right formula, though, I knew it immediately. The cake was delicate and golden, tasting subtly of vanilla with a faint hint of lemon. Now, when I see rows of these beauties on the speed rack at the bakery awaiting frosting, its hard not to slip into nostalgic reverie.	Preheat the oven to 325F. Line 2 standard 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.@newline@In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, potato starch, arrowroot, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the oil, agave nectar, applesauce, vanilla, and lemon zest to the dry ingredients and combine. Stir in the hot water and mix until the batter is smooth.@newline@Pour 1/3 cup batter into each prepared cup, almost filling it. Bake the cupcakes on the center rack for 22 minutes, rotating the tins 180 degrees after 15 minutes. The finished cupcakes will be golden brown and will bounce back when pressure is applied gently to the center.@newline@Let the cupcakes stand in the tins for 20 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack and cool completely. Using a frosting knife, gently spread 1 tablespoon vanilla frosting over each cupcake. Store the cupcakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.	1
1667	Beer-Marinated Flank Steak with Aji and Guacamole	Colombia may be the best kept barbecue secret in South America. Sure, Argentina gets the attention for its cowboy-style pasadop. And Brazil has enjoyed spectacular success exporting its prodiziop-style restaurantsthe kind where the waiters parade spits of grilled meats through the dining room. But Colombia? I doubt that most North Americans could name a single Colombian grilled dish. Well, it's time to shine the spotlight on the only country in South America to have coasts on both the Atlantic and the Pacific, whose cool-weather ranching district produces well-marbled, full-flavored beef, whose grill masters make extensive use of marinades (unlike the simplicity prized by their Argentine counterparts), and whose mastery of the art of grilling on charcoal extends to some unique techniques. Here's a not-so simple flank steak redolent of cumin, green onions, and beer.	Using sharp knife, lightly score flank steaks about 1/8 inch deep on both sides in a crisscross pattern at 1/2-inch intervals. Place steaks in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle steaks on both sides with oregano and cumin and generous amount of coarse salt and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle olive oil over both sides of steaks, rubbing oil and spices into meat. Add green onions, beer, and Worcestershire sauce, turning steaks several times to coat both sides. Cover and chill at least 3 hours, turning occasionally. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill rack lightly with oil. Grill steaks to desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes total per side for medium-rare, turning steaks 1/4 turn after 1 1/2 minutes to form crisscross grill marks, if desired. Transfer steaks to cutting board; let rest 5 minutes. Thinly slice steaks across grain. Transfer to platter and serve with Aji Sauce and Colombian Guacamole.	4

1669	Hot Dogs with Dal and Red-Onion Raita	An all-new version of franks and beans: The dogs are topped with lentils and an innovative take on praitap, India's ubiquitous yogurt-based condiment. If youd like to use naan (tandoor-baked flatbread) instead of hot dog buns, look for it at Trader Joe's storesin both the bakery and the frozen foods aisleor at Indian markets.	For dal: Rinse lentils; place in medium saucepan. Add 21/2 cups water, cumin, and turmeric; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes.

1674	Grilled Shrimp with Fiery Lemongrass-Chile Sambal	To read of my travels, you might get the impression that for most of the last three years, I've done nothing but prowl night markets and food stalls. True, a lot of great grilling takes place on Third World street corners, but you can also find some pretty amazing barbecue at luxury resorts. One such place is Amandari, a hotel built right into a rice paddy near the artist town of Ubud, Bali. Dinner began with a Balinese welcome dance performed by local children in gold-embroidered gowns. My wife, Barbara, and I dined at a table for two strewn with rose petals in an open pavilion facing a lily pond. A team of chefs cooked for us and us alone on portable grills over charcoal. The succession of dishesgrilled shrimp with fiery lemongrass psambalp, Balinese grilled chicken, and whole grilled fish with kaffir lime leavesrevealed Balinese cooking in all its polymorphic glory. A profoundly complex cuisine only hinted at in the food at your typical street-corner stall.	For sambal : Combine 6 Thai bird chiles (or 2 serrano or jalapeo chiles) and next 12 ingredients in processor. Using on/off turns, blend until finely chopped and paste forms. If spicier sambal is desired, add more chopped chiles to taste and blend again until paste forms. Transfer sambal to small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sambal and cook until fragrant and lightly browned, stirring constantly and adding more oil by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry, about 7 minutes. Add 1 cup water; reduce heat to medium and simmer until most of water is absorbed but mixture is still creamy, stirring often, about 4 minutes. Transfer to small bowl and cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover sambal and chill.	12

1678	Cheese-Stuffed Potatoes with Yogurt-Spice Paste and Sesame Seed Crust	If you want to study the art of meatless barbecue, India is the place to do it. This nation of more than a billion people has more vegetarians than there are people in the United States. Over the centuries, Indian grill masters have evolved a highly sophisticated style of vegetarian barbecuedishes bursting with flavor (not to mention dairy and grain proteins). It's grilling so complex and satisfying, you'll never miss the meat. Tandoori paloop (potato) turns up at grill parlors throughout northern India. The best I've ever tasted came from the landmark restaurant pMoti Mahalp in Delhi; the potatoes were packed with cheese, slathered with spice paste, and crusted with sesame seeds.

1679	Ginger and Honey Baby Back Ribs	Ribs are among the constants on the world's barbecue trail, but just how theyre prepared reflects a strong regional and cultural bias. The vast ranch lands and forests of the New World, for example, led to American-style barbecue, with its large slabs of spareribs slow-roasted on a smoker for the better part of a day. Asians adopted a different strategy: cooking small cuts or single ribs on tiny grills engineered for fuel efficiency. The flavor would come not from wood smoke (Asians don't have wood to burn by the cord), but from the explosively flavored seasoning indigenous to the region, like lemongrass, ginger, and fish sauce. Case in point: These Cambodian-style ribs, from Sarun Pich, a chef at the Amansara resort in Siem Reap, Cambodia.	For ribs and marinade: Place rib racks on work surface. Using small sharp knife, carefully pry papery membrane off underside of each rib section (use caution-it will be slippery). Place ribs on large rimmed baking sheet.@newline@Combine ginger, garlic, sugar, 1 tablespoon coarse salt, and black pepper in processor and puree to blend well. Add honey, soy sauce, and fish sauce and process until blended. Spread spiced marinade on both sides of ribs (about 2 tablespoons marinade per side for each rib section).

1702	Gingerbread Angels	When it comes to gingerbread, I almost always find that the allspice and cloves overpower the ginger flavor. To remedy that imbalance, I created a cookie with a double dose of ginger (ground and crystallized) and a little bit of cinnamon. And although the traditional cut for gingerbread is fat, sturdy men, I thought the lightness of angel wings seemed more appropriate for these delicate cookies.	Whisk flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, soda, and salt in large bowl. Place crystallized ginger in mini processor; add 1 tablespoon flour mixture and blend until ginger is very finely chopped. Using electric mixer, beat butter in another large bowl until smooth. Add 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time.

Wrap in plastic; chill at least 4 hours.@newline@Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Divide dough into 4 portions; shape each into round. Chill 3 rounds. Roll out remaining dough round on floured work surface to generous 1/8-inch thickness. Using floured angel-shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Gather dough scraps and reroll to generous 1/8-inch thickness; cut out more cookies. Using spatula, transfer cookies to sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Brush cookies with glaze, then sprinkle with raw sugar and/or colored sugar, if desired.@newline@Bake cookies until golden, reversing sheets after 7 minutes, about 14 minutes total. Let stand 2 minutes; transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining dough, cooling baking sheets between batches. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container.	8
1703	Mac and Two Cheeses with Caramelized Shallots	Instead of breadcrumbs, this mac and cheese is topped with rich, pungent caramelized shallots and creamy, crumbled goat cheese.	Preheat oven to 400F. Butter 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium.

Sprinkle with pepper. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.	11
1704	Gingerbread Trifle with Candied Kumquats and Wine-Poached Cranberries	Youll need a 7 3/4-inch-diameter trifle dish that is at least 4 3/4 inches deep. The recipe makes an extra gingerbread cake; have it for breakfast the next morning. If you prefer to make 12 individual trifles, use all three gingerbread cakes and cut each in half horizontally. Using a pretty glass as a guide, cut out 4 cake rounds from each cut cake layer. Alternate 2 cake rounds with 2 to 3 layers of the mascarpone cream, a few candied kumquats, and some poached cranberries in each glass.	For candied kumquats: Stir sugar and 1 1/2 cups water in large saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Add kumquats; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft mixture to medium bowl. Cool. Cover and chill until cold. DO AHEAD: Can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Before using, pour kumquat mixture through strainer; set kumquats aside for trifle. (Reserve syrup for another use.)	6

1706	Cinnamon-Caramel Bread Puddings	To complete the dessert buffet, bake a batch of Mexican wedding cakes (butter cookies rolled in powdered sugar).	Cut bread into 3/4-inch cubes. Place in very large bowl. Whisk eggs, milk, 1 cup cream, and next 4 ingredients in large bowl until sugar dissolves. Pour egg mixture over bread; toss to coat. Cover with plastic and place plate on top to submerge bread in egg mixture. Chill at least 4 hours or overnight.@newline@Stir bread mixture; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F. Butter sixteen 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins; divide between 2 roasting pans. Divide bread mixture among cups.

Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and Parmesan; drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Bake until fish is opaque in center, about 20 minutes.	2
1708	Death in the Afternoon	Camper English, a San Franciscobased writer, developed this adaptation of a classic drink recipe to showcase the use of absinthe, but Ernest Hemingway gets credit for the recipe. His advice, circa 1935: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly." We recommend drinking fewer than five. You may also try pouring the absinthe on top insteadsome brands of absinthe will float for a time on the Champagne, and this makes for a nifty visual effect.	Pour absinthe into Champagne flute. Add Champagne until a milky cloud appears, then serve.	2
1709	Lisa Loeb's Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies	Editor's note:p pLisa Loeb shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. To read more about Lisa and get a peek inside her kitchen, see our pCelebrity Kitchen Tour videosp.p	Using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar at high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add peanut butter and beat until thoroughly incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl, add the egg, and beat until smooth, about 20 seconds.@newline@In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder. Add dry ingredients to butter-sugar mixture and beat at low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, then add milk and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.@newline@Gather and press dough together, then divide into 2 equal pieces. Using a sheet of waxed paper as an aid, form each piece of dough into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap logs tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. (Dough can be made ahead and frozen in an airtight bag for up to 6 months).@newline@Preheat oven to 400F and lightly butter 2 large baking sheets.@newline@Cut each log crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and arrange slices 1/2 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Top each cookie with a 1/2-teaspoon dollop of jam.@newline@Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned and centers are set, about 10 minutes. Cool on sheets 2 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (Cookies will keep, stored in a covered container at room temperature, up to 2 days.)	6
1710	Brownie Sundae	Put out several flavors of ice cream and let guests help you by making their own desserts!	1. Place half of the brownie in the bottom of a small dessert plate.@newline@2. Let guests choose one small scoop of ice cream to place on top of it. Drizzle with a tablespoon of the chocolate sauce; top with some of whipped cream.@newline@3. Cover the ice cream with the remaining brownie half, pressing down slightly. Top with a second scoop of ice cream, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Finish with a cherry.	4
1711	Chocolate Tiramisu	"Classic tiramis doesn't usually contain chocolate, but I love how it pairs with the coffee. It's just one of those magical flavor combinations." Kriss Harvey	For espresso syrup: Stir espresso and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; set aside.	12
1712	Raw Artichoke Salad, Celery, and Parmesan	To prevent cut artichokes from browning, work with 1 artichoke at a time and lightly toss it in the lemon dressing as you go.	Whisk oil and juice in a medium bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, break off outer leaves until only pale-green ones remain. Cut 1/2" off the top; trim dark green parts around stem and heart. Slice lengthwise very thinly and toss in dressing. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Mix in celery and remaining ingredients. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and top with cheese.	9
1713	Mango-Chile Ice	We modeled this simple frozen dessert on a favorite ppaletap, or Mexican ice pop. You won't need an ice cream maker, but do plan ahead so that you have time to pure the ice in a processor three separate times for the smoothest texture.	Set a strainer in a 13x9x2" glass baking dish. Combine half of all ingredients with 5 tablespoons water in a processor and pure until smooth. Strain mango mixture into dish. Pure the remaining ingredients with 5 tablespoons water and strain mango mixture into dish. Freeze until mixture is slushy, about 2 hours. Working in 2 batches, pure in processor again. Return mango ice to same dish. Freeze 2 hours. Repeat 2 more times. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.@newline@Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Scoop into dishes, sprinkle with chile powder, if desired, and serve.	5
1714	Roman Style Pizza with Roasted Cherry Tomatoes	Roll or stretch the dough as thin as possible to get a classic thin and crispy crust.	Combine 3/4 cup warm water (105-115F), sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; let sit until spongy, 4-5 minutes. Mix in 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour. Turn out onto a work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticking, about 6 minutes. Grease a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil. Add dough, cover bowl with plastic; let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Meanwhile, position one rack in top third of oven and another in bottom third; place a pizza stone on top rack and preheat oven to 500F. Scatter tomatoes on a large rimmed baking sheet. Add 1 tablespoon oil, toss, and season with salt and pepper. Place on lower rack; roast until skins split, 10-12 minutes. Let cool on rack. Continue heating pizza stone for 45 more minutes.@newline@Sprinkle a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet with semolina. Divide dough in half; roll or stretch each into a 13x9" rectangle. Cover with kitchen towels; let stand for 15 minutes. Transfer 1 rectangle to prepared pizza peel. Brush with 2 tablespoons oil, sprinkle with half of the Parmesan, then mozzarella, and top with half of the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.@newline@Set front of peel at far edge of stone; gently jiggle peel side to side, sliding pizza onto stone as you remove peel. Bake until crust is browned and crisp, 9-10 minutes. Using peel, transfer pizza to work surface. Garnish with basil. Slice and Serve.@newline@Repeat to make second pizza.	10
1715	Salmon Tartare	Use the freshest wild or farmed salmon for this dish. Chilling it in the freezer for 20 minutes makes it easier to dice.	Place salmon on a plate; freeze until well chilled, about 20 minutes.@newline@Thinly slice salmon lengthwise into 1/8"-wide sheets. Cut each sheet into 1/8"-long strips. Cut strips crosswise into 1/8" cubes. Place salmon in a medium bowl. Add cucumber and the next 9 ingredients and toss to combine. Season tartare to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer tartare to a bowl and serve with chips.	5
1716	Ultimate Mud Pie	Chase Utley is not a dessert guy, unless it is mud pie. Once you try this incredible dessert recipe, you, too, will find your dinner guests unable to turn away a serving of bliss.	1 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan.@newline@2 To make the crust, combine the crumbs, melted butter, and sugar in a medium bowl until moistened. Press firmly and evenly into the pie pan. Bake until the crust is set and smells like warm cookies, about 12 minutes. Cool completely.@newline@3 To make the filling, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat 2 1/2 cups of the half-and-half, the sugar, and the salt, stirring often to dissolve the sugar, until simmering. Pour into a heatproof bowl. Rinse out the saucepan.@newline@4 In a small bowl, sprinkle the cornstarch over the remaining 1/2 cup half-and-half and whisk until dissolved. Whisk the yolks in a medium bowl, and gradually whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Gradually whisk in the hot half-and-half mixture and return to the rinsed-out saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a flat wooden spatula (to keep the mixture from scorching), until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture bubble, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, butter, and vanilla, and whisk until the chocolate melts completely. Strain through a wire sieve into a clean bowl.@newline@5 Pour the filling into the cooled crust and press plastic wrap directly on the filling to keep a skin from forming. Let cool completely. Refrigerate until the filling is chilled and set, at least 2 hours.@newline@6 To make the topping, whip the cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a chilled medium bowl with an electric mixer set on high speed until stiff. Uncover the pie. Spread and swirl the topping over the filling. (If you wish, transfer the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe the cream onto the pie.) Sprinkle pie with cookie crumbs. Slice and serve chilled.	3
1717	Baked Peaches with Amaretti and Cocoa	Peaches are abundant in the area around Piacenza. My mom's mother, Nonna Stella, used to use them in this traditional dish during the months when the peaches were at their best. In fact, my mom likes to tell me how, when she was pregnant, she ate them nonstop.p	Butter a baking dish large enough to hold 8 peach halves in a single layer.@newline@Cut the peaches in half with a small knife and remove the pits. Cut off the peel in strips. Place the peach halves in the baking dish as you finish peeling them.@newline@Use a melon baller to scoop out some of the center pulp from each peach, being careful not to perforate the edges, to make little containers for the filling.@newline@Put the peach pulp on a cutting board and finely chop it; transfer it to a small bowl. Add the cookie crumbs, the egg yolk, and the cocoa powder, and stir to combine.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F and center a rack in the oven. Divide the filling among the peach halves. Pour the wine into the dish around the peaches. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a thin crust forms on the filling. Let cool to room temperature or refrigerate until chilled. Serve with whipped cream, if you like.	8
1718	Personal Paella with Squid and Scallions	Ask my Catalan friend Pep and my Catalan-wannabe friend Ted which of the three of us makes the best paella, and prepare to hear much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then you'll hear many excuses about exactly how and why I, neither having the privilege of a) growing up in Spain (Pep) nor b) having written a newspaper story about paella after interviewing the Spanish cooking authority Penelope Casas (Ted), managed to mop the floor with both of them in a paella cook-off when I lived in Boston several years ago. What can I say? The crowd was the judge, and the choice was clear. Of course, paella is a renowned dish for groups: In Spain, cooks will put a gargantuan paella pan over a huge fire to feed dozens. But with the right pan (I love my trusty steel crepe pan), it's easy enough to make for one, too.	Preheat the oven to 400F.@newline@Combine the seafood stock, saffron, and pimenton in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer; reduce the heat to very low and cover.@newline@Lightly season the squid with salt and pepper. In an 8-inch cast-iron or other heavy skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the squid and cook, stirring frequently, just until the squid lose any translucence and exude their juices, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer the squid to a plate and decrease the heat to medium.@newline@Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil, then the red pepper flakes, scallions, and garlic and saut until the scallion starts to soften, another 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and cook until the grains are well coated with the pan mixture, 1 minute.@newline@Pour in the hot broth and bring to a gentle boil. Decrease the heat to medium-low. Taste the liquid and add salt to taste, then let it continue to gently bubble, swirling the pan occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the rice has swelled and absorbed much of the liquid; it should still be slightly soupy.@newline@Stir in the squid and tomatoes. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the rice is al dente, or mostly tender but with a little resistance in the center.@newline@Remove the pan from the oven, cover with a lid or aluminum foil, and let it sit for about 5 minutes, until the rice is tender. Uncover and return it to the stovetop over medium-high heat and cook for about 2 more minutes, to brown the bottom of the rice.@newline@Spoon it out onto a plate, and eat. Don't worry if it sticks. Just scrape it up and know that this is what the Spanish call soccarat , the crispy pieces that are considered a sign of a great paella.	11
1719	Cobb Salad with Balsamic Shallot Vinaigrette	It is a salad, but cobb salad was never meant to be a healthful or low-fat dish. Because Ryan Howard is a conscientious eater, however, this version is a lighter version that still packs some punch from the familiar flavors of the original. Use reduced-fat blue cheese and turkey bacon, serve the dressing on the side, and dig into this classic mega-salad.	1 To make the vinaigrette, combine the vinegar, salt, and pepper in a blender. With the machine running, gradually add the oil. Add the shallots and pulse briefly to combine. Pour into a serving bowl and set aside.@newline@2 Pound each chicken breast half between 2 heavy duty plastic bags with a flat meat pounder to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Season with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning halfway through cooking, until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes. Add  cup water, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer until the chicken feels firm when pressed in the center, about 8 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat to high, and cook until the liquid is evaporated and the chicken is sizzling, about 1 minute. Transfer chicken to a carving board and let cool. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.@newline@3 Spread the lettuce on a large platter. Top with the chicken, tomatoes, avocados, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and blue cheese arranged in rows. Serve immediately, with the vinaigrette passed on the side.	12
1720	Black Pepper Tofu	You will definitely surprise yourself with this one. It is an extremely delicious dish that's quick and straightforward to make, but looks as if it's been prepared at a top Chinese restaurant. It is fiery, both from the chiles and the black pepper; you can moderate this by reducing their quantity a little. However, the whole point is spiciness so don't go too far.	Start with the tofu. Pour enough oil into a large frying pan or wok to come 1/4 inch up the sides and heat. Cut the tofu into large cubes, about 1 x 1 inch. Toss them in some cornstarch and shake off the excess, then add to the hot oil. (You'll need to fry the tofu pieces in a few batches so they don't stew in the pan.) Fry, turning them around as you go, until they are golden all over and have a thin crust. As they are cooked, transfer them onto paper towels.@newline@Remove the oil and any sediment from the pan, then put the butter inside and melt it. Add the shallots, chiles, garlic and ginger. Saut on low to medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients have turned shiny and are totally soft. Next, add the soy sauces and sugar and stir, then add the crushed black pepper.@newline@Add the tofu to warm it up in the sauce for about a minute. Finally, stir in the green onions. Serve hot, with steamed rice.	11
1721	Eggplant with Buttermilk Sauce	I can't think of a more rustically elegant (is that a contradiction in terms?) starter. Serve with some robust white bread or pita and you are, literally, in food heaven. In the recipe you'll find Sami Tamimi's technique for getting the seeds out of the pomegranate, which I am afraid is now a very well-known secret.	Preheat the oven to 200F. Cut the eggplants in half lengthways, cutting straight through the green stalk (the stalk is for the look; don't eat it). Use a small sharp knife to make three or four parallel incisions in the cut side of each eggplant half, without cutting through to the skin. Repeat at a 45-degree angle to get a diamond-shaped pattern.@newline@Place the eggplant halves, cut-side up, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush them with olive oilkeep on brushing until all of the oil has been absorbed by the flesh. Sprinkle with the lemon thyme leaves and some salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, at which point the flesh should be soft, flavorful and nicely browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool down completely.@newline@While the eggplants are in the oven, cut the pomegranate into two horizontally. Hold one half over a bowl, with the cut side against your palm, and use the back of a wooden spoon or a rolling pin to gently knock on the pomegranate skin. Continue beating with increasing power until the seeds start coming out naturally and falling through your fingers into the bowl. Once all are there, sift through the seeds to remove any bits of white skin or membrane.@newline@To make the sauce. Whisk together all of the ingredients. Taste for seasoning, then keep cold until needed.@newline@To serve, spoon plenty of buttermilk sauce over the eggplant halves without covering the stalks. Sprinkle za'atar and plenty of pomegranate seeds on top and garnish with lemon thyme. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.	10
1722	Slow-Cooked Pulled Pork Sandwiches	This is Josh Hamilton's favorite sandwich to eat with his family, especially when he comes home after a game. Katie must like making it, too, because it is a classic slow-cooker recipe that needs very little attention. The payoff is meltingly tender pork in a sweet sauce. To round out the meal Southern-style, serve the sandwiches with coleslaw, baked beans, or fries.	1 Lightly season the pork with salt and pepper. Place in a slow cooker insert, add the barbecue sauce, and cover. Cook on low until the pork is fork-tender, 8-9 hours.@newline@2 Skim off any fat from the sauce surface. Transfer the pork to a carving board. Let stand for 5 minutes. Using two forks, shred the pork, discarding any excess fat. Return to the slow cooker.@newline@3 Heap the meat and sauce onto the buns and serve hot.	12
1723	Wild Garlic and White Bean Curry	The beauty and subtlety of wild garlic makes this dish very appealing, and fresh curry leaves add a fragrance that is quite seductive. During the summer months we pod fresh coco beans and cook them directly in the curry until soft. In winter we soak dried cannellini beans overnight and precook them in water for an hour or so over gentle heat, with one or two herbs added for flavor. I like to serve this curry just as it is, but you could add chunks of white fish to it.	Have the beans ready podded, or cooked if using dried beans. Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onions until soft and translucent.@newline@In a separate pan, warm all the spice seeds until they release their fragrance and just begin to jump in the pan. Tip into a mortar and grind with the pestle while still warm.@newline@Add the warm ground spices to the softened onions along with the chiles, curry leaves, lime leaves, and minced cilantro root. Cook for another 5 minutes over fairly low heat, then add the crushed garlic, jaggery, lime juice, and fish sauce. Stir well and cook for 5 minutes.@newline@Add the tomatoes, stir well, and cook for another 10 minutes, then add the fresh or cooked dried beans and coconut milk. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes (or until the beans are tender if cooking fresh).@newline@While the curry is cooking, wash the wild garlic very well, picking over each leaf thoroughly for they can carry little stones.@newline@A couple of minutes before serving the curry, add the wild garlic and cook until it is just wilted and soft. Don't overcook itwild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. This curry should be soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you	2
1724	Ready for Guests Roasted Pears	When coring the pears, make sure you also remove the fibrous portion along the line of the stem. Then, before serving, make sure to let the pears cool until they are just warm or room temperature. The flavor and texture is much richer once they've cooled. In fact, these pears are perfect for a dinner party or an event where food may be sitting out for a bit; the flavor actually gets better as they rest. Keep in mind the cooking time may vary depending on the variety of pear you use. Some are considerably firmer than others, so if the pears don't seem cooked enough after the suggested cooking time below, continue roasting them until they're very tender. It could take up to an additional half-hour if you get a really firm variety.	Preheat the oven to 350F. Line an 8- x 8-inch baking dish with parchment. Lightly mist the parchment with spray. Crinkle a piece of foil to form a log about 12 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 1 inch in diameter. Set the log in the center of the baking dish. Cut the pears in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the cores and remove the stems. Place the halves on the prepared baking sheet so the tips rest on the log (this is to ensure the pears lay flat so the glaze doesn't drip out during baking). Drizzle the butter evenly over the pears. Then sprinkle the brown sugar, followed by the cinnamon, evenly over the top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until very tender. Allow the pears to cool until they're just warm or room temperature, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.	4
1725	Skirt Steak with Hazelnut Picada and Wilted Escarole	Picada hails from Spain, or more specifically, from Catalonia. Flavored with nuts, bread crumbs, and herbs, it is a punchy, vibrant pasteoften used as a sauce to enliven dishes, and to thicken stews. Here it partners full-flavored skirt steak and elegant escarole lettuce, which is just wilted to serve as a vegetable. Like romesco, there are plenty of other uses for picada, if you have any leftover.	Set the steaks aside on a covered plate to bring them to room temperature.@newline@For the picada, preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Tear the bread roughly into pieces. Heat the olive oil in a shallow pan over medium heat. When it is hot, add the bread and pan-fry until evenly golden and crisp. (Take care that the olive oil does not become too hot and begin to smoke.) Remove and drain off excess oil. Pound the bread, in batches if necessary, using a mortar and pestle, until you have coarse bread crumbs. Place the nuts on a baking sheet and roast in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes until evenly golden. Tip the hot nuts into a clean dry cloth and rub to remove the skins. Mince the nuts and place in a bowl with the bread crumbs, orange zest, and juice. Mince the garlic and oregano together and add to the bowl with a pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then set aside. Turn the oven to its lowest setting.@newline@Discard the outer leaves from the escarole, then tear the lettuce into large pieces. Wash well, but don't bother to pat dry. Season the steaks liberally all over. Place a heavy skillet over high heat and brush the steaks with a little olive oil. Lay the steaks in the skillet when it is hot and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side for 3 minutes (you may need a minute or two longer if the steaks have been cut from a thicker section of the thigh). You should have a nice brown crust, while the meat inside should be rare. Remove to a plate and rest in the warm oven for 6 to 8 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, cook the escarole. Place a wide pan over medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it just melt, then add the torn leaves and seasoning. Put the lid on until the water clinging to the leaves begins to steam, then uncover and stir every few seconds so the leaves wilt uniformly. This will take 2 to 3 minutes. Now you should have a lovely glossy, pale green vegetable. Check the seasoning. Place a steak on each warm serving plate and arrange the escarole alongside. Spoon over the picada and serve at once.	9
1726	Pink Grapefruit, Avocado, and Watercress Salad	This elegant, light salad is ideal to serve as a first course. Pink grapefruit and peppery watercress cut the richness of avocado, and a scattering of toasted hazelnuts and hazelnut oil in the dressing suggest a flavor of early fall. Prosciutto is a graceful inclusion, but you can leave it out for a lighter vegetarian salad if you like.	Dressing: First make the dressing. Combine the mustard and sherry vinegar in a bowl and add a pinch each of salt and pepper. Whisk in the olive oil, followed by the hazelnut oil to emulsify, then set aside.	9
1727	Asparagus Roast Beef Roll-Ups	This recipe is a great one to impress guests at your next cocktail party (though you'll have to multiply it). It's really quick and simple, yet it looks very decadent and time-consuming. To make the roll-ups extra elegant for entertaining, wrap the roast beef close to the bottom of the spears, then stand them on a platter.	Stovetop Instructions: Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Place a steamer rack insert in a large pot. Fill the pot with water so it reaches just below the steamer rack. Place the pot over high heat, cover it with a lid, and bring the water to a boil. Add the asparagus, cover the pot (leaving the lid slightly ajar), and steam the asparagus until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes, depending on thickness. Transfer the asparagus to the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain well. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the horseradish and sour cream until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Lay 1 1/2 ounces of the beef on a flat work surface or cutting board. Spread one-quarter (about 1/2 tablespoon) of the horseradish mixture over the beef, leaving a small border. Place 3 asparagus spears at one of the narrower ends of each beef slice so the tips hang over. Roll the beef around the bundle of asparagus until you reach the other end of the beef.

1728	Cold Provenal White Bean Salad	One of the things I enjoyed most on my first visits to France were the cold rice and bean salads. They seemed so simple, and the only rice and beans I had eaten at home were hot and served in soups or casseroles, or under some creamed meat. Here is a typical French-style cold white bean salad.	Thoroughly rinse the beans and place them and the water in the slow cooker insert. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or until the beans are tender. Quickly and gently pour them into a colander and drain them. (You can reserve the cooking water and use it to thicken soups or stews.) Transfer the beans to a serving bowl.@newline@In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, mustard, and garlic. Blend thoroughly with a whisk or an immersion blender.@newline@Pour the dressing over the beans and mix thoroughly. Add the green onions, olives, and salt and pepper to taste, and toss by hand (or if you must, using spoons).@newline@Serve either chilled or at room temperature on lettuce leaves and garnish with the tomato wedges.	4
1729	Zuppa di Cavolo Nero, Cannellini, e Salsicce: Kale, White Bean, and Sausage Soup	Kale goes by another name, one much more dashing, especially in Italian. Cavolo Nero, black cabbage, may not evoke superhero status, but it's close. Kale does seem invincible and it's known to make the eater more so, too. It's also called dinosaur kale (also called lacinato), maybe because its leaves look like the back of a lizard. Those thin knobby leaves squeak. Do not confuse cavolo, accent on the first syllable, with cavallo, accent on the second, or you'll be ordering black horse, and in certain parts of the world will find it. Hearty and good for the spirit. I like soaked and cooked cannellini better than canned ones.	Saut the crumbled sausage in the oil until browned, and reserve. Saut the onions and garlic until translucent.@newline@Add to the chicken stock in a big pot. Add the wine and cook until the alcohol has evaporated, then add the thyme and kale. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the cooked sausage and the beans and simmer another 15 minutes.	11
1730	Honeyed Prawns & Polenta	This recipe presents a fun variation on the traditional dish of shrimp and grits associated with the southeastern coastal regions of the United States. Polenta, thyme, capers, feta cheese, and currants update the classic with Mediterranean flavors. The inclusion of honey injects just the right amount of sweetness to complement the dish's many savory flavors. I encourage the use of sustainably raised and harvested prawns here, as they exact a considerably smaller toll on our global aquatic ecosystems.	1. Preheat the oven to 400F (204C). Butter an 8 x 10-inch (20.3 x 25.4 cm) baking dish. Oil a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Set the pans aside.@newline@2.

Set the bowl aside, giving it a stir every few minutes.@newline@3. For the polenta: Bring 3 cups cold water to a boil in a medium stainless-steel pot. Add the polenta. Cook seven minutes, stirring often. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.@newline@4. In a large bowl, mix the corn (completely thawed if frozen), currants, honey, butter, and thyme. Stir in the polenta, and season with salt and pepper to taste.@newline@5. Add polenta mixture to the buttered baking dish. Spread evenly with a spatula, and place in the oven to bake for 35 minutes.@newline@6. Spread the prawn mixture evenly onto the oiled baking sheet. After the polenta has baked for 25 minutes, add the prawns to the oven, alongside the polenta. Place both pans on same rack if possible; otherwise, place the baking sheet on the lower rack.@newline@7. Bake the prawns for five minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and flip all of the prawns over. Return to the oven and bake an additional five minutes, until the polenta is slightly browned and the prawns are pink and firm.@newline@8. Remove the prawns and the polenta from the oven. To serve, scoop individual servings of the polenta onto plates. Lay a few prawns over each serving, then top with crumbled feta, fresh parsley, and capers. Drizzle with a few lashings of hot sauce, if desired.	8

Invert cake and peel off parchment now on top.@newline@Beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks, then spread evenly over top of cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle crystallized ginger over cream. Roll up cake, starting from a short side, to make a 10-inch log, removing parchment as you go.@newline@If desired, slices of roulade can be frozen (up to 1 week), then lightly sprinkled with turbinado sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw) and broiled (do not thaw first) in a shallow baking pan 5 to 6 inches from heat until golden, about 3 minutes.	5
1764	Cauliflower Souffl with Brown Butter	Don't be frightened by the word souffl. This subtly sophisticated dish isn't difficult at all (just be careful not to overbeat the egg whites).	Make Souffl: Preheat oven to 400F with rack in middle.@newline@Generously butter souffl dish, then sprinkle with cheese, knocking out excess.@newline@Stir together cauliflower, parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and white pepper to taste in a large bowl.@newline@Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat.

1767	Lamb Tagine with Prunes and Cinnamon	This well-balanced stew is intense yet mellow. The prunes soak up the fragrant spices, and long, slow cooking turns the lamb fork-tender.	Toss together lamb, onion, 3 tablespoons oil, spices (except saffron), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot.@newline@Lightly toast saffron in a dry small skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until just fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.

1768	Coco Cola	Even the gastronomic wizard who invented this recipe calls the name gimmicky, but who cares? The clever technique of using both a seltzer charge and a cream charge gives you a foamy, snow-white dessert with an almost ethereal lightness.	Blend together coconut water, coconut powder, sugar, and xanthan gum in a blender. Pour mixture into soda syphon and seal well.@newline@Charge syphon with seltzer charge, shaking syphon a few times. Carefully remove empty seltzer charge, then charge syphon with cream charge. Shake syphon vigorously several times, then fill Champagne flutes or other tall, skinny glasses.	5
1769	Adobo Chicken in Parchment	This ingenious technique cooks the chicken in a purse with its own juices and a mix of spices. It slowly simmers the bird to a silky richnessan enticing side of chicken that we rarely see.	Slit guajillo chiles lengthwise, then stem and seed. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot, then toast chiles in batches (with guajillos opened flat), turning and pressing with tongs, until more pliable and slightly changed in color, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to a bowl and soak in boiling-hot water until softened, about 15 minutes.@newline@Drain chiles, then pure in a blender with 1 tablespoon sea salt and remaining ingredients except chicken and remaining sea salt until adobo is very smooth, about 1 minute.@newline@Sprinkle chicken with remaining 3/4 teaspoon sea salt.

Set steamer racks (on top of each other) over boiling water in a pasta pot (use 2 pots if you can't layer your racks) and steam, covered tightly, until chicken is very tender and starting to fall off the bone, 1 3/4 to 2 hours. (Replenish water as necessary.)@newline@Carefully transfer each package to a shallow bowl. Remove kitchen string and slowly slide parchment out from underneath chicken and broth. Season with salt.	6
1770	Steamed Chicken with Xiao Fan's Special Sauce	Xiao Fan's spicy sauce will transform not only this steamed chicken but also plain rice, noodles, tofu, even grilled steak. The sauce can be doubled and leftovers chilled for a week. To reheat, add a bit of broth or water and simmer for about a minute.	Steam chicken: Fit a large steamer rack inside a large wide pot. Add enough water to reach within 1/2 inch of bottom of rack. Bring to a boil.@newline@Pat chicken dry and put, skin side up, in a shallow bowl (that will fit on steamer rack inside pot). Sprinkle with ginger and steam, covered, over high heat, until chicken is just cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes (replenish water if necessary).@newline@Carefully remove bowl with chicken. Pour off juices into a glass measure and set aside 1/4 cup (reserve remainder for another use). Return chicken in bowl to pot and keep warm, covered, off heat.	11
1771	Celery Apple Granita	Before the storm of desserts comes the palate-cleansing calm. This playful, snowy mound of savory celery with hints of green apple and tarragon refreshes after the preceding spread. Counterintuitive as it may seem, taking a break before dessertto eat a pre-dessertwill help you enjoy the sweet abundance that awaits.	Crush vitamin C tablet in a bowl with back of a spoon, then line a sieve with dampened flour sack cloth and set over bowl.@newline@Pure apples with 1/3 cup water in a food processor (do not use a blender) until almost smooth, then pour into cloth. Bunch up cloth around mixture and squeeze as much clear juice as possible through cloth (about 11/2 cups). Discard solids remaining in cloth. Rinse and wring out cloth, then return to sieve.@newline@Pure tarragon with remaining 1/3 cup water in processor until water is deep green, then add celery and pure until almost smooth. Pour into lined sieve and squeeze out juices (about 1 1/2 cups) into bowl with apple juice. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.@newline@Freeze mixture in an 8-inch square baking dish, scraping and stirring with a fork every 30 minutes, until frozen, at least 3 hours. (It will be too hard to scrape once fully frozen.)	2
1772	Chipotle Meatballs	Albndigas (meatballs) are often served in a soup or a sauce, but our skewered version needs only a squeeze of refreshing lime juice to bring out their meaty richness. Spicy chipotle, crumbled bacon, and a hint of cumin make them unforgettable.	Stir together milk and bread crumbs in a large bowl.@newline@Cook bacon in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.@newline@Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, then cook onion, garlic, chipotles, cumin, and oregano in skillet, stirring, until onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add water and cook, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until water has evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir into bread crumb mixture, then add ground meats, egg, parsley, bacon, and 1 teaspoon salt and mix well with your hands.@newline@Preheat broiler.@newline@Form scant tablespoons of meat mixture into balls and thread 3 balls 1/2 inch apart onto each skewer, arranging skewers on a lightly oiled broiler pan. Broil 3 to 4 inches from heat (do not turn) until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.	1
1773	Sauted Lemon Maple Frise	Frise often pops up in salads, but like its cousin escarole, its also great for cooking.	Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook bread crumbs until crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in zest and a pinch of salt.@newline@Wipe out skillet, then add anchovy paste and remaining 2 Tbsp oil and cook 15 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high and saut half of frise until slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Add remaining frise and saut until wilted, about 2 minutes more. Off heat, stir in juice, syrup, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.@newline@Serve topped with bread crumbs.	4
1774	Parmesan-Roasted Butternut Squash	The best qualities of a gratin shine in this incredibly simple side dish: Pieces of sweet butternut squash and a flurry of salty Parmigiano-Reggiano meld with cream to form a warm, cohesive whole.	Preheat oven to 400F with rack in middle.@newline@Toss squash with cream, sage, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Bake, covered, 30 minutes.@newline@Stir in half of cheese and sprinkle remainder on top. Roast, uncovered, until squash is tender and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Let stand about 5 minutes before serving (cream will thicken).	3
1775	Grass Fed Beef with Herbs	This type of beef can have more omega-3 fatty acids, which may curb inflammation in the body, than that from conventional cattle. And the cows are often more ecologically and humanely raised.	Blend all ingredients except beef and coarse salt in a food processor. Rub on meat; marinate 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator, turning meat once or twice. Heat oven to 400F. Heat a medium cast-iron pan over medium heat. Sear meat on all sides until it has a brown crust. Transfer pan to oven; roast meat until internal temperature is 120F, 15 to 25 minutes. Remove; let meat rest 20 minutes (internal temperature will rise to 130F). Slice, sprinkle with coarse salt and serve with Yellow and Green Bean Salad .	9
1776	Lentil Croquettes	Editor's note:p The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Crescent Dragonwagon's book pPassionate Vegetarianp. pDragonwagon also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.p@newline@pFor most of our years as innkeepers, these croquettes, served with shiitake mushroom gravy and accompanied by a small stuffed pumpkin and other fixings, were the entree we offered vegetarians at Dairy Hollow Thanksgivings. Though rather plain as far as savory cakes go, the deep, dark colors and flavors are autumnal and satisfying. Sure, most guests chose turkey, but vegetarians were ecstatic about these. In fact, one of my sources of residual Innkeeper Guilt is the nice thank-you note I got from two such, begging me for the recipe. I am not territorial about recipes and had no problem  or wouldn't have, if I'd ever measured what I did. They actually called the front desk ptwicep to ask again (Guilt! Guilt!) but by the time I had measured, and written, a year had gone by. I sent the recipe, groveling and apologetic. Alas, they had moved, forwarding service expired. If you two are out there reading this, I hope you will accept my apologies.p	1. Combine the lentils, water, and bay leaves in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook, half-covered, until tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool, then drain off any excess liquid and set aside.@newline@2. When ready to complete the croquette batter, combine the lentils with all the other batter ingredients in a food processor. Buzz until the garlic is pureed and a soft, somewhat goopy paste is formed. Let the batter rest, covered and refrigerated, for at least 4 hours, or up to 2 days.@newline@3. When ready to bake the croquettes, preheat the oven to 400F. Set up a breading station: Combine the breadcrumbs and cornflake crumbs in a bowl. In a second bowl, make a seasoned flour by combining the flour, nutritional yeast, paprika, sage, salt and black pepper, thyme, and olive oil and tossing together well. In a third bowl, beat the egg, if using, with a tablespoon of water. Place the bowl of croquette mixture next to all this, along with a nonstick baking sheet or one that has been sprayed with cooking spray.@newline@4. Using 2 large spoons, form a slightly flattened fat oval 3 to 4 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. Drop it into the seasoned flour. Sprinkle the top of the oval of batter with more flour and lift it out of the flour with your fingers. Dip the batter oval into the egg, which will coat it, though it will resist in spots. Drop the egg-coated ball into the crumbs, and, with your fingers, roll it around. When coated with this second jacket of crumbs, place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the batter.@newline@5. Spray the crumbed croquettes very lightly with olive oil (if you have some in a spray bottle) or cooking spray. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turn very gently using a thin-bladed spatula, and bake for another 10 to 12 minutes. The crumb coating should be crisping up nicely; if it's not, run the croquettes under the broiler for a few moments.@newline@6. Serve hot, as soon as possible, with a sauce such as Mushroom-Miso-Mustard Gravy . Leftovers can be served in buns, with all the fixings.	11
1777	Roasted Turkey Breast with Corn Bread-Sage Stuffing and Brandy Gravy	The Thanksgiving turkey conundrum: How to keep the breast meat from drying out while the dark meat finishes cooking? By roasting a bone-in turkey breast by itself, we've eliminated the stress and cut the cooking time by several hours. What you get is perfectly moist, tender white meat with crisp, salty skinall in under an hour. If you don't have time to make the gravy, skip it. This succulent bird doesn't need it.	Make stuffing: Preheat oven to 425F and grease 9-by 13-inch roasting pan.@newline@In large skillet over moderately high heat, melt butter. Add onion, celery, garlic, nutmeg, pepper, and bay leaf, and saut until vegetables soften, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in sage and cook 30 seconds more. Stir in stock and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.@newline@Put corn bread in large bowl and pour vegetables over. Toss to mix well. Add eggs and stir to combine.	7
1778	Neo-Classical Thanksgiving Dressing with Apricots and Prunes, Stuffed in a Whole Pumpkin	Editor's note:p The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Crescent Dragonwagon's book pPassionate Vegetarianp. pDragonwagon also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.p@newline@pThis is my favorite Thanksgiving stuffing  in fact, this is my ponlyp Thanksgiving stuffing. I've made it for at least twenty-five years, and it's always pleased me, friends, family, and inn guests. To my taste, it wouldn't be right with margarine or oil, just butter. But pprobablyp it wouldn't be bad with less fat or a different one. I make the vegetarian version with vegetable stock, for use in a pumpkin; when I cooked at the inn, where the majority of the guests were meat eaters, I also did a batch with turkey stock.p	Pumpkin prep: Cut off and reserve a lid, as you would preparatory to carving a jack-o'-lantern. Scoop out all of the seeds and fibers. Put an inch or two of water in a large pot. Place the pumpkin, cut side down, in the water, cap wedged in near it. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover tightly and team for 10 to 15 minutes to precook slightly. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool. When cool, remove from the pot. Since the pumpkin will be eaten with the stuffing, I like to season the inside with salt, pepper, a little tamari, Pickapeppa, and brown sugar, rubbing this into the exposed interior flesh after steaming.	2
1779	Fried Polenta Cheese Fritters	This easy, indulgent appetizer comes from cookbook author Daisy Martinez. The fritter batter can be made one day ahead.	Lightly oil 8x8x2-inch metal baking pan. Whisk first 4 ingredients in bowl. Bring milk and 1 cup water to boil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually whisk in dry ingredients. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until very thick, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in cheese. Transfer batter to prepared pan; press to even layer. Chill until cold.@newline@Cut fritter batter into 3 strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 8 rectangles. Turn rectangles out of pan onto work surface. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add fritters to skillet and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to paper towels to drain. Arrange fritters on platter. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.	7
1780	Late Summer Tomato Soup with Shell Beans, Squid Rings and Parsley	Be well this fall: Have one bowl and you'll spoon up nearly three quarters of your daily requirement for vitamin C.	Heat oven to 375F. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper; roast 40 minutes. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a soup pot over low heat. Cook leek, onion and sliced garlic 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add wine, raise heat to high and reduce 5 minutes. Place tomatoes, oregano, 1/4 cup parsley and shelled beans in pot and add enough water to cover vegetables by 1/2 inch. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Add flat beans, salt and cayenne; simmer until beans are tender, about 30 minutes. Mix squid with chopped garlic and remaining 2 tablespoons parsley; let stand 30 minutes. When soup is ready, sautsquid: Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a medium saut pan over high heat until oil smokes, 2 to 3 minutes. Add squid (oil may splatter) and saut, stirring, until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. Toast bread; rub with garlic clove. Divide soup among 4 bowls, top each with 1/4 squid mixture and add bread.	8
1781	Roasted Plums with Greek Yogurt	If plums aren't available, pears are an easy alternative. And with calories this low, go aheadindulge in seconds!	Heat oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place plums cut side up on sheet, brush with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until soft and some juices run off, about 15 minutes. Divide among 4 bowls, top each with 2 tablespoons yogurt, sprinkle with nuts and drizzle with honey.	6
1782	Roasted Kabocha Squash with Cumin Salt	Use this flavor-enhancing salt on any meat or fish, or even on cheese.	Heat oven to 375F. Combine cumin seeds with bay leaf and paprika in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder and process briefly. Add sugar and salt and process to combine. Set aside. Toss squash with oil, then cumin mixture. Spread on 2 baking sheets and roast until tender, about 25 minutes.	4
1783	Fricassee of Game Hen with Creamy Leeks and Vadoum	This fricassee couldn't be more French, but its velvety sauce carries the flavor of pvadouvanp, a South Indian spice blend that has started to crop up on Parisian menus. We find it irresistible.	Make stock: Heat oil in a heavy medium pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook backbones and wing tips until well browned on all sides. Add water and bring to a boil, skimming froth occasionally. Add remaining ingredients and boil, uncovered, 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan, pressing on and then discarding solids. Boil stock until reduced to about 2 cups.	3
1784	Scarlet Poached Pears	Though poaching pears in wine often results in a subtle, sophisticated dessert, it rarely looks as lovely as it tastes. Here, Grimes took inspiration from the saturated-red glassware that's ubiquitous in Parisian flea markets and from a dessert at Le Chateaubriand, which uses beet to give the pears a lush garnet hue. As far as its flavor goes, the beet doesn't lend anything more than a nice balance to the overall dish, but you'll probably want to poach pears this way from now on.	Bring wine, beet, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and bay leaves to a boil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quarts saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved.@newline@Add pears and cover with a round of parchment paper. Simmer, turning occasionally, until pears are tender and liquid is syrupy, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer pears to a bowl. Discard cinnamon stick and bay leaves and pour syrup over pears. Cool completely in syrup, about 30 minutes.	11
1785	Ham, Manchego, and Fig Tartines	NoDescription	Stir together butter and fig preserves. Spread mixture on baguette, then make open-face sandwiches with ham and cheese. Drizzle with oil and season with pepper.	2
1786	Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes	Creaminess is added to buttery Yukon Golds with just olive oil and potato water.	Cover potatoes with cold water in a pot and add 2 teaspoons salt. Boil, partially covered, until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water and drain potatoes.@newline@Heat oil in pot over medium heat and remove from heat. Force potatoes through ricer into oil in pot. Stir in cooking water, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and salt to taste.	4
1787	Ginger Cardamom Oeufs  la Neige	Inspired by a dessert served at Le Bistro Paul Bert, in Paris, we used Indian spices to restyle this elegant classic custard. It takes its French name ("eggs in the snow") from the lightly poached dollops of meringue that top it.	Line bottom of a small 4-sided sheet pan with parchment paper.@newline@Separate 2 eggs; put yolks in a large bowl and whites in another. Add whole egg to yolks.@newline@Beat whites with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks. Add 1/2 cup sugar in a slow stream, beating at medium-high speed until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks.@newline@Meanwhile, bring milk to a bare simmer with ginger and cardamom in a wide 4-quart heavy pot over medium heat.@newline@Drop 4 large dollops of beaten whites into milk and poach at a bare simmer, turning once, 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to lined pan (reserve milk).@newline@Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, and salt into yolk mixture. Add hot milk in a slow stream, whisking until incorporated, then return to pot. Cook, stirring often, until thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 170F. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in vanilla.@newline@Quick-chill custard by setting bowl in an ice bath and stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Ladle into 4 bowls and put a meringue in each. Sprinkle with nuts.	1
1788	Poached Eggs with Mushrooms Two Ways	This substantial early-fall dish was inspired by one served at Au Vieux Chne, in Paris. Roasting some of the mushrooms and sauting the rest until just warmed through creates different flavors and textures. Cumin seedspopular with today's Parisian chefsdeepen the earthiness.	Prepare mushrooms: Preheat oven to 450F with racks in upper and lower thirds.@newline@Thinly slice two thirds of mushrooms 1/8 inch thick. Toss with 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then spread evenly in 2 large 4-sided sheet pans. Roast, switching position of pans and stirring mushrooms occasionally, until all of liquid has evaporated and mushrooms are golden and crisp, 30 to 40 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, cut remaining mushrooms into 1/2-inch wedges. Finely chop parsley with garlic. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sautmushroom wedges with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper 1 minute. Add red-wine vinegar and saut 1 minute. Stir in parsley mixture and butter and saut until butter has melted. Season with salt. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered.	11
1789	Snap Beans with Mustard and Country Ham	To many Southerners, green beans are "snap beans" because they "snap" when you break them. This recipe, my own, combines three southern favorites: green beans, mustard, and country ham. I like these beans best with roast turkey, grilled or roast chicken. But they're equally delicious with pork chops or roast pork. Some southern supermarkets sell biscuit slices, slim rounds of country ham ready to cook and slip into biscuits. Others sell country ham by the piece or the pound. If it's not available in your area, you can order it from pthevirginiacompany.comp. Note: pBecause of the saltiness of the ham, the mustard, and the broth, these beans are unlikely to need additional salt. But taste before serving and adjust as needed.	1. Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over moderate heat, add the ham and scallions, and cook, stirring now and then, for 5 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned.@newline@2. Add the beans and broth and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat so the broth bubbles gently, cover, and cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until the beans are crisp-tender.@newline@3. Meanwhile, combine the thickener and the mustard and set aside. As soon as the beans are done, whisk a little of the hot broth into the mustard mixture, stir back into the pan, add the pepper, and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes or until the broth thickens. Continue cooking uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the sauce has the consistency of a glaze.@newline@4. Taste the beans for salt and pepper, adjust as needed, and serve straightaway.	1
1790	Pumpkin Praline Trifle	A pretty centerpiece dessert that's a cross between a trifle and tiramis. To give the flavors time to meld, youll need to put the trifle together at least one day ahead, but it tastes best when made two days ahead. Any leftover praline would be terrific sprinkled over ice cream.	For praline: Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray. Bring both sugars and half and half to boil in heavy medium saucepan over mediumhigh heat, whisking to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes, whisking constantly. Add butter, vanilla, and salt. Attach candy thermometer to pan. Simmer without stirring until temperature registers 260F, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat; immediately mix in pecans. Transfer to prepared sheet, spreading in single layer. Cool completely. Chop into 1/4-inch pieces.	2
1791	Sweet Potato Casserole	I particularly like this sweet potato casserole because it isn't candy-sweetno marshmallows, no canned crushed pineapple, no honey, and not very much sugar. I don't boil the sweet potatoes before I mash them; I bake them so they're less watery and have better flavor. Here's how: Pierce each sweet potato with a sharp-pronged kitchen fork, set on a baking sheet, then bake on the middle oven shelf for about 1 hour at 400 F. or until you can pierce a potato easily with a fork. Cool the potatoes to room temperature, peel, then mash until light and fluffy.	1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter a 2-quart casserole and set aside.@newline@2. Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl, beating until smooth. Taste for salt and pepper and adjust as needed.@newline@3. Scoop into the casserole, spreading to the edge and roughing the surface. Bake uncovered on the middle oven shelf for about 45 minutes or until tipped with brown.@newline@4. Serve hot as an accompaniment to roast turkey, chicken, or pork. Good, too, with pork chops.	2
1792	Angel Biscuits	I remember exactly when I first encountered these celestial biscuits. It was in the early 1970s as I prowled the South in search of great grassroots cooks to feature in a new series I was writing for pFamily Circlep magazine. Through country home demonstration agents, I obtained the names of local women who'd won prizes at the county and state fairs. I then interviewed two or three of them in each area before choosing my subject. And all, it seemed, couldn't stop talking about "this fantastic new biscuit recipe" that was all the ragesomething called Angel Biscuits. The local cookbooks I perused also featured Angel Biscuits, often two or three versions of them in a single volume. Later, when I began researching my pAmerican Century Cookbookp, I vowed to learn the origin of these feathery biscuits. My friend Jeanne Voltz, for years the pWomen's Dayp food editor, thought that Angel Biscuits descended from an old Alabama recipe called Riz Biscuits, which she remembered from her childhood. Helen Moore, a freelance food columnist living near Charlotte, North Carolina, told me that a home economics professor of hers at Winthrop College in South Carolina had given her the Angel Biscuits recipe back in the 1950s. "I remember her saying, 'I've got a wonderful new biscuit recipe. It's got yeast in it.'" Others I've queried insist that Angel Biscuits were created at one of the fine southern flour millers; some say at White Lily, others at Martha White (and both are old Nashville companies). In addition to the soft flour used to make them, Angel Biscuits owe their airiness to three leavenings: yeast, baking powder, and baking soda. Small wonder they're also called "bride's biscuits." They are virtually foolproof.	1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.@newline@2. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the texture of coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and yeast mixture and toss briskly with a fork just until the mixture forms a soft dough.@newline@3. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and with floured hands, knead lightly for about a minute. With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out until 5/8 inch thick; then, using a well-floured 2 1/2- to 2 3/4-inch cutter, cut into rounds. Place on ungreased baking sheets, spacing about 1 1/2 inches apart. Gather scraps, reroll, and cut as before.@newline@4. Bake in the lower third of the oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until the biscuits are nicely puffed and pale tan on top. Serve at once with plenty of butter.	1
1793	Confit Duck Legs	As convenient as store-bought duck confit is, we find that its quality tends to vary. Making your own allows you to control the spicing and the cooking time to produce a velvety piece of meat. This ancient preservation method has three parts: First you cure the duck legs in salt (drawing out the water in which microorganisms can live), then you slowly cook them in fat, and finally you store them fully covered in the cooking fat so air can't get in.	Mince and mash 4 garlic cloves to a paste with a pinch of kosher salt. Stir together paste, kosher salt (1/4 cup), thyme, quatre pices, shallots, and bay leaves in a large bowl. Add duck legs and toss to coat, then marinate, covered and chilled, at least 1 day and up to 2 days.@newline@Wipe off marinade with paper towels.@newline@Trim off 1/4 inch from top of garlic head, then stick 2 whole cloves into head. Melt duck fat in a wide large heavy pot over low heat, then cook garlic head and duck legs, uncovered, over low heat until fat registers approximately 190F, about 1 hour. Continue to cook duck, maintaining a temperature of 190 to 210F, until a wooden pick slides easily into thighs, 2 to 3 hours more.@newline@Transfer duck with a slotted spoon to a large bowl (reserve garlic for another use if desired). Slowly pour duck fat through a fine-mesh sieve into a large crock or deep bowl, leaving any cloudy liquid or meat juices in bottom of pot, then pour strained fat over duck legs to cover by 1 inch. (If necessary, shorten drumstick bones 1 to 2 inches using a large heavy knife to fit legs more tightly in bowl.) Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, then chill, covered, at least 8 hours.@newline@Just before serving, remove duck from fat (reserve fat for another use, such as frying), scraping off most of fat, then cook, skin side down, in a large heavy nonstick skillet over low heat, covered, until skin is crisp and duck is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes	3
1794	Shrimp in Ginger Butter Sauce	Ginger and cilantro add Southeast Asian oomph to this French-style butter sauce, which lightly coats big, meaty shrimp.	Pat shrimp dry and season with salt@newline@Heat butter in a heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until foam subsides, then saut ginger 30 seconds. Add shrimp and saut 2 minutes. Add Sherry and saut until shrimp are just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper.	1
1795	Creamy SauerKraut Gratin with Duck Confit	For this beautifully balanced dish, food editor Paul Grimes drew inspiration from the Alsace region of France, where it is common to pair preserved meats with sauerkraut. We love how the fat of the confit tempers the sharpness of the sauerkraut, which in turn is smoothed out by the creamy custard perfumed with juniper. It makes a great autumn dinner, perfect with a green salad and a cold beer. One note: Do not rinse the kraut (preferably the bagged fresh kind found in the refrigerated section) or you will lose its engaging acidity.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Butter baking dish and coat with bread crumbs. Chill until ready to use.@newline@Cook onion with bay leaf and juniper berries in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Discard bay leaf.@newline@Meanwhile, remove skin and bones from duck legs, reserving skin and discarding bones. Tear meat into 1-inch pieces and stir into sauerkraut. Transfer to baking dish.@newline@Whisk together cream, milk, eggs, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then pour over sauerkraut. Bake until custard is set and edges are lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, remove skin and bones from duck legs, reserving skin and discarding bones. Tear meat into 1-inch pieces and stir into sauerkraut. Transfer to baking dish.@newline@Whisk together cream, milk, eggs, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then pour over sauerkraut. Bake until custard is set and edges are lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes.@newline@While custard bakes, thinly slice reserved skin, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook in a dry medium nonstick skillet over low heat, stirring to separate, until fat is rendered and skin is crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve gratin with crisp skin scattered on top.	8
1796	Duck Confit with Potato Leek Ragout	This rustic, one-dish meal incorporates ingredients that southwestern France is known for: prunes, Armagnac, leeks, potatoes, and mushrooms. The ragout's combination of sweet, salty, and earthy acts as a complex backdrop for the duck.	Wash sliced leeks and pat dry. Remove duck meat (with skin) from bones in large pieces, reserving meat and bones separately.@newline@Simmer prunes and Armagnac in a small saucepan until Armagnac is absorbed, about 3 minutes.@newline@Heat rendered duck fat in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook mushrooms with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.@newline@Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook leeks with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, stirring once or twice, until beginning to soften and brown on edges, about 6 minutes.

Add prunes (with any juices), remaining cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender and liquid is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. (If liquid hasn't thickened, remove lid and boil.)@newline@Meanwhile, cook duck meat, skin side down, covered, in a large heavy nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until skin is well browned and crisp and meat is heated through, about 15 minutes.@newline@Discard bones and bay leaf from ragout, then season with salt and pepper and serve topped with duck confit.	6
1797	Country Pt with Mango and Pineapple Chutney	This fresh chutney combines pineapple with a recent Parisian obsessionmangoesfor a vibrant counterpoint to rich pt.	Bring sugar and water to a boil with star anise in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally so caramel colors evenly, until pale golden. Carefully add vinegar, red-pepper flakes, and 1/8 teaspoon salt (caramel will spatter and harden). Continue to cook until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and cool 10 minutes.@newline@Pour syrup over fruit in a bowl and gently stir. Chill at least 4 hours.@newline@Bring chutney to room temperature before serving with pt	6
1798	New Coq au Vin	Celeryoften dismissed as one of the produce world's poorest relationscontributes an intriguing earthiness to moist chicken infused with the flavors of white wine and garlic.	Pat chicken dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sear chicken, skin side down, in 2 batches until golden brown (do not turn), 3 to 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate.@newline@Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet.

Add water and bring to a simmer.@newline@Return chicken, skin side up, to skillet and simmer, partially covered, until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.	4
1799	White Bean Soup with Duck Confit	Evocative of cassoulet but so much easier, this bean soup manages to be both rugged and elegant. No part of the confit duck legs goes to waste: The bones add savor to the beans, the meat goes into the soup, and the crisped skin makes a delectable garnish. Flambing the Armagnac before adding it to the pot takes the edge off the alcohol while leaving behind the deep flavor of the barrel.	Quick-soak beans by putting them in cold water to cover by 2 inches in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then boil 1 minute. Remove from heat and cover, then soak 1 hour. Drain, discarding liquid.@newline@Remove skin and bones from duck legs, reserving both, then coarsely shred meat.@newline@Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook reserved bones, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and cloves, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 8 minutes.@newline@Add drained beans, broth, water, and tomatoes and simmer, partially covered, stirring and skimming froth occasionally, until beans are tender, about 50 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, thinly slice reserved skin, then lightly season with salt and pepper. Cook in a dry medium nonstick skillet over low heat, stirring to separate, until fat is rendered and skin is crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.@newline@Discard bay leaves, bones, and thyme from soup. Transfer 2 cups solids and 1 cup liquid from soup to a blender and blend until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids), then return to soup. Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and keep warm, covered.@newline@Heat Armagnac in a small saucepan over low heat just until warm, then carefully ignite with a kitchen match (use caution; flames will shoot up). When flames subside, stir Armagnac into soup along with meat, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve sprinkled with crisp skin.	7
1800	Seared Bass with Cauliflower Duo	Nutty fried cauliflower florets plus raw shavings of the vegetable's stem give flaky striped bass more complexity (and panache) than the usual fish with lemon.	Shave floret portion of cauliflower with a knife to create cauliflower "confetti" (3 to 4 cups). Set aside. With slicer, cut thin lengthwise slices from base and stem, dividing among 4 plates.@newline@Heat vegetable oil and 1/4 cup olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until oil shimmers, then fry cauliflower "confetti" in 4 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, seasoning lightly with salt.@newline@Discard oil and wipe out skillet.

Top with cauliflower confetti and drizzle with vinaigrette.	2
1801	Passover Pasta Primavera	Pasta made with matzo cake meal is extremely light in texture and is no fuss to prepare when it's rolled and cut by hand into thin strips. The vegetables, in shades of green, provide a range of spring color.	Make pasta: Stir together matzo meal and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Make a well in center and add eggs and yolk, then lightly beat eggs with a fork. Add water and oil and stir until dough just comes together. Knead dough 5 or 6 times. Form into a 5-inch square and put on a work surface dusted with potato starch, then dust dough with potato starch. Let stand 10 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, dust a large baking pan with some potato starch. Quarter dough. Roll out each piece on a surface dusted with potato starch until as thin as possible (1/16 inch thick) and about 10 by 8 inches, dusting rolling pin and surface of dough as needed. (If dough tears, patch it.) Using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut into long 1/2-inch-wide strips and transfer to pan in 1 layer along with any broken pieces of dough.@newline@Cook in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander.	4
1802	Spiced Matzo-Stuffed Chicken Breasts	Food editor Melissa Roberts drew on the influences of her husband's Lebanese heritage when she created this dish, rich with the spices and textures of the Middle East. Each bite of chicken combines crisp skin with moist meat and is savory with a hint of sweetness. Pistachios and raisins pump up the "chew" factor.	Preheat oven to 425F with racks in upper and lower thirds.@newline@Cook onion and bell pepper in 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, about 15 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes.@newline@While onion mixture cooks, rinse matzo farfel in a colander under warm running water until softened, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Pack 3 tablespoons stuffing into each pocket. Pat chicken dry and add to spices, tossing to coat.@newline@Straddle a large flameproof roasting pan across 2 burners, then add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and heat over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sear chicken, skin side down, until skin is deep golden, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over, then roast in upper third of oven until just cooked through, 16 to 20 minutes.@newline@Transfer chicken to a platter and straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then add wine and deglaze by boiling, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Stir in 3/4 cup broth. Whisk together remaining 1/4 cup broth and potato starch and whisk into sauce, then cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

1803	Butternut Squash Cappellacci with Sage Brown Butter	These "hats" are a classic dish in Ferrara, where you'll find them filled with a range of different things, from meat to vegetables. In this version, the toasted flavor of the butter and the herbal quality of the sage in the sauce really bring out the nuttiness of the parmesan and butternut squash in the filling.	Make filling while dough stands: Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Brush cut sides of squash with oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total). Roast in a shallow baking pan until golden brown and tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then use a spoon to scoop out flesh, transferring it to a medium bowl and discarding rind. Stir in cheese, nutmeg, bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste.	6
1804	Pasta with Spicy Anchovy Sauce and Dill Bread Crumbs	Even if anchovies aren't part of your culinary heritage, the way the sweetness of the onions and the saltiness of the fish interact, combined with the tactile pleasure of the crunchy bread crumbs, will have you missing your nonna no matter what your nationality.	Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook bread crumbs, stirring constantly, until deep golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.@newline@Transfer bread crumbs to a bowl and toss with dill and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and black pepper.@newline@Wipe out skillet, then cook onions with 1/4 teaspoon salt in remaining 1/2 cup oil over medium heat, stirring frequently, until very soft, 12 to 15 minutes.

Put packages on hot baking sheet and bake until fish is just cooked through, 15 to 22 minutes.	2
1807	Tomato Focaccia	In the States, we tend to be familiar only with the bready, crisp-topped version of focaccia, but this Pugliese take on ittowering, savory, and so light it's almost cakelikewill surely become a new favorite. Food editor Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez learned the secret to a springy, rich varietya potato mashed into the doughfrom her husband's cousin Lucia Erriquez (yes, with two r's) Castellana, who comes from Bari. A salty top and tangy tomatoes that go almost buttery on the crust will have everyone reaching for a second piece.

Cut into pieces and serve warm or at room temperature.	12
1808	Octopus Salad	Salads like this one are found all over Puglia, almost always with carrot, celery, and parsley (we suspect the locals like the combination as much for its gorgeous color contrast with the octopus as for its freshness and crunch) and lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon.

Put sage, then sausages and scallions, inside flap and tie roast with string.@newline@Put roast, bone side down, in a large roasting pan with celery and olives, then pour in wine and remaining cup oil. Roast 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 325F and roast, basting meat every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat (do not touch bone) registers 155F, about 2 hours more. Let stand 15 minutes. Serve with pan juices.	3

1825	Galician Pie	Editor's note:p The recipe and introductory text below are fromp p1080 Recipesp pby Simone and Ins Ortegap.p	Mash the yeast with a pinch of salt and the lukewarm water in a cup or small bowl until smooth, then let stand for about 10 minutes, until the mixture is frothy. Beat two of the eggs in a bowl. Sift the flour with a pinch of salt onto a work surface. Make a well in the center and pour in the beaten egg and yeast mixture. Gradually incorporate the flour into the liquid, then knead well for 10 minutes. Dust the surface lightly with flour to prevent the dough sticking. Add the margarine and knead for 10 minutes more, banging the dough onto the surface. Add a little water to the dough if necessary. Once the dough is smooth and elastic, form it into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover with a clean dish towel. Let rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled in volume. Meanwhile, make the "rustido." Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Add the onions and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and parsley and cook for 5 minutes more. Stir in the chorizo and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside. Heat the sunflower oil in a skillet. Add the strips of meat and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for about 8 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350F. Brush a 12-inch baking pan or ovenproof baking dish with oil. Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly bigger than the other. Roll out the larger piece on a lightly floured surface and use to line the pan or dish. Spread half the rustido over the dough. Lay the strips of meat on the rustido and add the strips of bell pepper. Spoon the remaining rustido over the top. Roll out the remaining dough and use it to cover the mixture. Seal the edges of the dough carefully, pressing them together and rolling them slightly. Pinch the dough in the center of the pie with two fingers to create a chimney to allow the steam to escape. Beat the remaining egg and brush it over the dough to glaze. Bake for 15 minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 375F, and bake for 15 minutes longer. Increase the oven temperature to 400F and bake for 15 minutes more, until golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven. Serve hot or warm, straight from the dish, if you prefer.	6
1826	Fried Chicken Masala	My friends Rene and Carl Behnke are consummate hosts and gourmands, and fried chicken is one of their favorite dishes to offer a hungry crowd. Rene's secret for an amazingly crispy and crunchy crust, which is now mine (and yours), is to let the chicken rest in flour as the oil heats. I have adapted her recipe, giving it an Indian twist. Indians (like many southern Americans) love buttermilk, so it's natural to use it as a liquid for the overnight brine. I add spices to the brine and flour coating to give the chicken an extra hit of flavor.	To make the brine, mix the buttermilk with all of the spices in a large bowl. Transfer to a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken, turn to coat, and refrigerate overnight.@newline@Heat 1 inch of canola oil in a large heavy-bottomed high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 375F. In a shallow bowl, whisk the flour with the spices and add the chicken pieces. Turn to coat in the flour and let the chicken rest in the flour until the oil gets hot. Tap off the excess flour and add as many pieces of chicken to the skillet as you can. Fry until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the chicken over and fry until the chicken is deeply browned on the other side, about another 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken pieces to a paper towellined plate to drain. Serve while warm or at room temperature.	5
1827	Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon	Editor's note:p The recipe and introductory text below are from Anne Willan's bookp pThe Country Cooking of Francep.p@newline@pLa Truffadep	Heat the bacon lardons in a 10-inch/25-cm frying pan over medium heat until the fat runs, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let them brown. Remove them with a draining spoon and set aside. Melt the lard in the pan, add the potatoes, and sprinkle them with pepper. The bacon may contribute enough salt. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the lardons and continue to cook, uncovered, over low heat, tossing or stirring often, until the potatoes are tender and some are browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Don't worry if some of them are crushed, as they will help hold the mixture in a cake.@newline@Stir in the cheese, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Press down on the potatoes to level them in the pan. Turn the heat to high and let them cook without stirring until the bottom is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Press on the cake occasionally to hold it together. When done, it should be brown around the edges and starting to pull from the sides of the pan. Take the pan off the heat, run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake, and turn it out onto a warmed platter. Serve hot.	8

Insert toothpick through each doughnut hole into cone to attach doughnut hole to cone, leaving end of toothpick sticking out (you'll push it in later with thimble).@newline@Attach second ring of doughnut holes above first, again packing tightly and staggering so doughnut holes in second ring are not directly above doughnut holes in first ring.@newline@Continue in same manner to attach remaining doughnut holes. For top tiers, if desired, slice off small amount of each doughnut hole on side facing toward cone to make shape more tapering. Finish covering cone with 1 doughnut hole attached to top of cone.@newline@Using thimble, push in toothpicks until not visible.@newline@Decorate by pushing candies and leaves into gaps between doughnut holes. If candies won't adhere, dip in corn syrup-water mixtur before attaching.@newline@If desired, drizzle with chocolate or caramel sauce. Croquembouche keeps, covered loosely with aluminum foil and refrigerated, 2 to 3 days.	8
1829	Skirt Steak Fajitas	Skirt steak, which is full of flavor and holds marinades well, is the essential beef cut for fajitas.	1. Cut the steak crosswise into 2 to 4 pieces and place in a bowl.

1865	Almond Praline Semifreddo with Grappa-Poached Apricots	Apricots and almonds have an affinity for each other, as you'll discover in this marriage of the stone fruit and a cool psemifreddop dotted with crushed almond praline.

Spoon into loaf pan and freeze, covered, until firm, at least 6 hours.	5
1866	Pork Tenderloin with Tomato-Peach Compote	The compote here is a reminder that the tomato is a fruit, and its natural sweetness plays up that of peach.

Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and bake at 350F until they turn golden brown. (I do mine in the toaster oven.)

Transfer them to a small bowl and let them cool.@newline@Cut each slice of prosciutto in half, crosswise. Don't worry if they're not perfect. Top each half-slice with a small piece of arugula, a dab of gorgonzola, a few pine nuts, and few currents. Then roll them into little mini horns.@newline@Arrange on a platter and serve.	5

1995	Spicy Horseradish Mustard	Packed into a sealable crock or mason jar, this condiment makes a wonderful gift. Once you become familiar with the recipe, it can be customized: You can take out the horseradish and garlic for a more mellow experience, change the vinegar from cider to red wine for more tang, or sub whole brown mustard seeds for the yellow for a darker, nuttier flavor. One thing to remember: The flavors benefit from two weeks of aging in which to meld, so it's best to start this project a bit before the holidays. If pressed for time, however, simply attach a tag with the date on which you recommend the crock be opened.	In large jar, combine all ingredients and 1/2 cup water and shake well. Cover and refrigerate 48 hours. In food processor, process mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide among 6 (4-ounce) sterilized mason jars. Seal jars and store in cool, dark place for 2 weeks before opening. (Mustard can be eaten immediately, but flavors will not have had a chance to meld.)	12
1996	Quince Apple Strudels with Quince Syrup	Served with small scoops of ice cream and a pink-hued syrup, this fruit-filled dessert delivers a glorious finale to a special dinner. Strudel dough looks more difficult to make than it really is. The secret is using bread flour, a high-gluten flour, which allows you to stretch a small amount of dough over a large surface.	Make quince syrup and filling: Combine quince with reserved star-fruit syrup in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into mixture, then add pod and strip of zest. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until quince is very tender and begins to turn pinkish, 50 to 60 minutes.@newline@While quince is simmering, put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400F.@newline@Meanwhile, toss apples with butter, finely grated zest, salt, and 1/4 cup sugar in a large shallow baking pan until coated well, spreading in an even layer. Roast, stirring occasionally, until apples are very tender and any liquid they release is evaporated, 45 minutes to 1 hour.@newline@Pour quince mixture into a large sieve set over a bowl, discarding pod and zest, and reserve syrup. If syrup measures more than 1 cup, return to saucepan and boil until reduced to about 1 cup; if less, add enough water to total 1 cup. Cool syrup completely.@newline@Stir together quince and cherries in a large bowl. Fold roasted apples and lemon juice into quince mixture and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.@newline@Pulse bread in a blender or food processor to fine crumbs, then add nuts and remaining 1/4 cup sugar and pulse just until nuts are finely chopped. Set aside.	2
1997	Red Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette	We were surprised at how many different varieties of gorgeous red lettuces and red greens we were able to find to create this visually stunning salad. Tossed with a simple vinaigrette, it is a lovely counterpoint to the richness of the meat and potatoes.	Whisk together vinegar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Add lettuces and greens and toss to coat. Serve immediately.	4
1998	Glazed Red Pearl Onions	We know they're a pain to peel, but we promise that these jewellike pearl onions are worth it. Cooked until just tender, they make a dazzling addition to the meal.	Blanch pearl onions in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling water 1 minute, then drain in a colander. When onions are cool enough to handle, peel.@newline@Cook onions with remaining ingredients, covered, in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, shaking pan occasionally, until onions are tender and glazed and most of liquid is evaporated, about 45 minutes. Discard thyme.	10
1999	Prime Rib Roast with Red-Wine Sauce	Big and beefy, this luscious cut of meat definitely has a celebratory presence. Here it partners with porcini mushrooms, which are both rubbed on the roast and incorporated into the sauce. For the best flavor, look for well-marbled meat.	Cook roast: Let roast stand at room temperature 1 hour.@newline@Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450F. Trim all but a thin layer of fat from roast, then rub roast all over with porcini powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a rack set in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan. Roast beef 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350F and roast until thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 110F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Transfer to a large platter and let stand, uncovered, 30 minutes. (Internal temperature of meat will rise to 130F for medium-rare.)	11
2000	Lobster Gelees with Fresh Tarragon Oil	This dramatic first course won't soon be forgotten. Chunks of sweet lobster meat bound by a shimmering jelly of fennel-and-tarragon-scented lobster stock promises the most pristine lobster salad you'll ever taste.	Cook lobsters and make stock: Bring 6 quarts water to a boil in pot, then plunge 2 lobsters headfirst into water and cook, covered, 8 minutes from time they enter water. Transfer with tongs to a shallow baking pan to cool. Return water to a boil and cook remaining 2 lobsters in same manner.@newline@When lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove meat from tail and claws and set aside. Cut tail shells and lobster bodies (not including claws) into 1-inch pieces with kitchen shears, then rinse well, discarding gills, eye sacs, tomalley, any roe, and claw shells. Transfer to a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot, then add wine, carrots, celery, fennel, onion, garlic, large tarragon sprigs, salt, fennel seeds, red-pepper flakes, and remaining 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 6 cups, about 1 1/2 hours.@newline@While stock reduces, scrape any coagulated white albumin from lobster meat with a knife and cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces, then chill, covered.	7
2001	Beet Consomm	This is a more refined version of borscht, the Slavic classic. Often, borscht's underlying flavor comes from using ham or a beef broth, but here smoked turkey becomes the secret ingredient, imparting a smoky depth that's not too heavy.	Boil beets, covered, in water (4 quarts) in a 6- to 8-quart pot over moderate heat until tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer beets with a slotted spoon to a plate to cool slightly, reserving cooking water. When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins. Cut 1 beet into 1/4-inch dice and reserve for garnish. Cut remaining beets into 1/2-inch pieces and return to cooking liquid in pot. Add turkey, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, dill sprigs, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns and simmer, partially covered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Pour soup through a dampened cheesecloth-lined sieve set into a 3-quart heavy saucepan, discarding solids. Measure soup: If there is more than 6 cups, boil in cleaned pot until reduced; if there is less, add enough water to total 6 cups.@newline@Skim fat from consomm, then add lemon juice and sugar and heat until hot.@newline@Divide diced beet and chopped dill among 8 shallow soup plates and ladle consomm on top.	10
2002	Trio of Mini Pound Cakes	These tiny cakes make terrific gifts, packaged in sets of three  one of each flavor. The basic vanilla batter is also wonderful for other variations  try orange rind and white chocolate-chip, raisin-walnut, or "the kitchen sink" (that's whatever you need to get rid of in your pantry). I also like to keep some of these loaves in my freezer for impromptu breakfast parties. Just move them to the refrigerator before bed, and they'll be thawed by morning.	Prep mix-ins In small bowl, combine poppy seeds and lemon juice. Set aside. In second small bowl, toss together chocolate chips and flour. Set aside. In third small bowl, gently mash banana. Set aside.	9
2003	Panettone with Candied Fruit	This is an all-day project, but it's worth the work. The repeated risings give the yeast time to add extra flavor and moisture, a difference you'll definitely taste in the finished product. The recipe will make two large loaves, perfect for holiday entertaining, or eight small ones, great for gift-giving. Well wrapped, they'll keep for days, and slightly stale leftovers can be turned into delicious into French toast.	Make biga: In bowl of standing mixer fitted with dough hook, combine 1/3 cup warm water (105F to 115F) and sugar. Stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add flour and mix at low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in warm, draft-free place until tripled in volume, about 3 hours. (Can be made 5 days ahead. Stir down starter, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)	11
2004	Seven-Layer Salmon Bites	You'll want to use the best Scottish smoked salmon and salmon roe, available at specialty foods shops, for these pretty nibbles.	Stir together cream cheese, zest, lemon juice, chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Stack bread slices, then trim to form 4 1/4- by 3 1/4-inch rectangles. Arrange rectangles in 1 layer. Spread each with 1 heaping tablespoon cheese mixture and top with a thin layer of smoked salmon (cut to fit with kitchen shears). Make 1 more layer each of cheese and salmon, then top with remaining cheese. Trim edges to make uniform and chill rectangles on a platter until tops are firm, about 1 hour. Cut rectangles into 8 (1 1/2- by 1-inch) pieces, then top each piece with a rounded 1/4 teaspoon roe.	10

Place chicken in very large resealable plastic bag; add brine and seal. Refrigerate chicken 6 hours.@newline@Drain chicken from brine; rinse and pat dry. Place chicken on plate. Let stand uncovered in refrigerator at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F. Place chicken on rack in roasting pan. Roast chicken 20 minutes; add 1 cup broth to roasting pan. Roast chicken 20 minutes longer; add 1 cup broth to roasting pan. Roast chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 170F, about 45 minutes. Let chicken rest 10 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, pour juices from roasting pan into 2-cup measuring cup. Add more broth if needed to equal 2 cups.

2026	Three-Cheese Pizza with Onion, Sage, and Arugula	Why a trio of cheeses? Fontina for its melting quality and nutty flavor, Gorgonzola for its biting blue punch, and Parmigiano-Reggiano for its uncanny ability to amplify other cheeses.	Make dough: Place pizza stone on floor of gas oven or on lowest rack if using an electric oven and preheat oven to 500F (allow 1 hour for pizza stone to heat).@newline@Stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/4 cup warm water in a measuring cup and let stand until mixture develops a creamy foam on surface, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, discard and start over with new yeast.)@newline@Stir together 1 1/4 cups flour with salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup warm water and stir until smooth. Stir in enough flour (about 1/2 cup) to make dough come away from sides of bowl. (Dough will be wetter than other pizza doughs you may have made.)@newline@Knead dough on lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands (reflour hands when dough becomes too sticky) until smooth, soft, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form dough into a ball, put on a lightly floured surface, and generously dust with flour. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/4 hours. Dust a wooden peel or a large baking sheet (without sides) with cornmeal.@newline@Do not punch down dough. Carefully dredge dough in a bowl of flour to coat and transfer to a dry work surface. Holding one edge of dough in the air with both hands and letting bottom just touch the work surface, carefully and quickly move hands around edge of dough (like turning a steering wheel), allowing weight of dough to stretch round to roughly 10 inches. Lay dough flat on peel or baking sheet. Continue to work edge of dough with your fingers, stretching it into a 14-inch round.	4
2027	Baked Shrimp in Chipotle Sauce	In this spin on New Orleans's classic appetizer of barbecue shrimp, chipotle chiles stand in for cayenne and black pepper, truly transforming the dish with a beguiling play of spice, a hint of smoke, and a gorgeous brick-red color. Here, we serve the shrimp as a main course  but in the spirit of the original, we've kept this a meal to eat with your hands. Peeling the shrimp, slurping their shells, and scooping up the hot, buttery sauce with crusty bread makes for nothing less than a feast. Best of all, it's ready in a flash.	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400F.@newline@Melt butter in a saucepan and stir in wine, Worcestershire sauce, chipotles with adobo sauce (to taste), garlic, and salt. Toss shrimp with sauce in baking dish and bake until shrimp are just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Sauce can be briefly simmered (with shrimp removed) to reduce it as needed.	1
2028	Rosemary Citrus Miso-Rubbed Turkey	We are happy to announce that Bev Jones has won our November "Cook the Cover" contest with her delicious variation on our pMiso-Rubbed Turkey with Turkey Gravyp.p@newline@pBev Jones explains her variation:p	Pulse about 1/4 of onion rings, plus rosemary and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Add black pepper, poultry seasoning, and miso paste and pure until smooth. Add butter and pure  mixture will appear curdled.@newline@Put oven rack in lowest position and preheat to 350F. Rinse turkey inside and out, then pat dry. Working from large cavity end, gently run fingers between skin and meat of breast to loosen skin, being careful not to tear skin. Push miso butter under skin, including thighs and drumsticks, and massage from outside to spread evenly. Place a lemon slice inside of a pepper ring and slide under skin, positioning evenly over breast and drumsticks. Repeat with remaining pepper and lemon slices until a pleasing pattern results. Sprinkle cavity with seasoned salt. Stuff cavity with lemon and orange quarters, squeezing juice into cavity as you go, and fold neck skin and flap into the cavity. Tie drumsticks together with kitchen string and tuck wings under body.@newline@Rub turkey with 2 tablespoons of oil.

2029	Semolina Pistachio Layer Cake (Bohsalini)	This no-bake dessert features alternating layers of savory pistachio-studded semolina and a cooked cream called pkashta,p set into a springform cake pan and chilled in the refrigerator overnight. If you are feeding a crowd, double the recipe and forgo the cake shape for a looser presentation: Spread all the semolina mixture on a large platter, spoon the kashta over it, and garnish with the nuts and powdered sugar; then spoon it into dessert bowls.p	Mix the melted butter and semolina in a medium bowl, and set aside at room temperature for at least 6 hours or as long as overnight.@newline@Pour the milk into a large pot and bring it to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. When the milk rises to the top of the pot, stir in the lemon juice and remove the pot from the heat. Set it aside to cool until the milk separates, 10 to 15 minutes.@newline@Pour the milk through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, stirring to release the whey. Discard the whey. Transfer the curds in the strainer to a large bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons rose water and the orange-blossom water with a wooden spoon. The kashta should look like small-curd cottage cheese. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Kashta will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.)@newline@Combine the sugar, pistachios, and remaining 1 tablespoon rose water in a food processor and pulse until the mixture has the consistency of coarse sand. Add the pistachio mixture to the flour mixture, and using your hands, mix them together, breaking up the lumps until the mixture feels like damp sand.@newline@Line a 9-inch springform cake pan with wax paper, using two pieces crossing at right angles and allowing lengths of paper to hang over the sides of the pan. Spoon half of the semolina mixture into the pan and smooth it out to the edges with the back of the spoon. Follow with all of the kashta, spreading it over the semolina in an even layer. Spoon the remaining semolina mixture on top and spread it out in an even layer. Fold the overhanging wax paper over the top, and press to smooth the semolina. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.@newline@Pour the olive oil into a skillet that is large enough to accommodate the nuts in a single layer. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the nuts, reduce the heat to low, and stir actively until they begin to darken slightly, about 1 minute (see Tips, below). Remove the pan from the heat, and use a slotted spoon to transfer the nuts to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. (Alternatively, dump the nuts into a medium-mesh sieve set over a container to catch the cooking oil.) Let them cool completely. (Fried nuts can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator or freezer for up to 3 months.)@newline@One hour before serving, remove the cake from the refrigerator, invert it onto a serving plate, and release it from the pan. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top: Hold a fine-mesh sieve over the cake, pour the powdered sugar into it, and gently tap the rim to release the sugar. Garnish with the nuts, and serve in wedges.	4

2041	Wild Garlic and White Bean Curry	The beauty and subtlety of wild garlic makes this dish very appealing, and fresh curry leaves add a fragrance that is quite seductive. During the summer months, we shell fresh coco beans and cook them directly in the curry until soft. In winter, we soak dried cannellini beans overnight and precook them in water for an hour or so over gentle heat, with one or two herbs added for flavor. I like to serve this curry just as it is, but you could add chunks of white fish to it.	Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onions until soft and translucent.@newline@In a separate pan, warm all the spice seeds until they release their fragrance and just begin to jump in the pan. Tip into a mortar and grind with the pestle while still warm.@newline@Add the warm ground spices to the onions along with the chiles, curry leaves, lime leaves, and cilantro.

Don't overcook itwild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. This curry should be soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you.	6
2042	Pizza Dough	Our dough is a little wetter than a standard bread dough, but this style produces the best results with our method of cooking: we use a hot griddle to parcook the ppizzap crusts. Our pan of choice is my own enameled cast-iron pizza griddle, but you can also use a 10-inch enameled cast-iron frying or grilling pan or a smooth cast-iron pancake griddle.	To make the dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.@newline@Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.@newline@Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.	9

2078	Almond, Chocolate, and Pistachio Spumoni	Spumoni trumps all others as the ideal frozen treat: It's richer than gelato, lighter than ice cream, and smoother than frozen custard. The inspiration for this classic flavor combination came from L & B Spumoni Gardens, in Brooklyn, a favorite spot for this tricolor treat.	Bring milk to a simmer in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk together yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Whisk in milk, then transfer mixture to saucepan.@newline@Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Immediately strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Divide custard among 3 bowls. To make almond base, whisk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla into 1 bowl; for pistachio base, whisk almond extract and food coloring into another bowl; for chocolate base, whisk cocoa and remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla into third bowl.@newline@Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Chill custards, surfaces covered with parchment paper (to prevent a skin from forming), until cold, at least 6 hours.@newline@Freeze each custard in ice cream maker, 1 batch at a time (white, then green, then brown). Fold almonds into vanilla custard, then fold pistachios into green custard. Transfer to a shallow 2-quart container or 3 smaller containers and put in freezer to firm up, about 4 hours.	11
2079	Broccolini with Italian Herb Oil	A generous drizzle of parsley-oregano oil brings a wave of herbal freshness to slender stalks of simply cooked Broccolini.	Cook Broccolini in a 5-to 6-quarts pot of boiling salted water (2 teaspoons salt for 4 quarts water) until just tender, about 6 minutes, then drain.@newline@Meanwhile, blend herbs, garlic, anchovy paste, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a blender until finely chopped. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream, blending until mixture is green and herbs are very finely chopped.@newline@Serve Broccolini tossed with herb oil.	3
2080	Mozzarella	If you live near a deeply rooted Italian community, chances are you have easy access to great fresh mozzarella. If that's not the case, though, it's time to channel your inner artisanal cheesemaker. You'll find that the pure, clean flavor of homemade mozzarella is a revelation, as is the cheese's tender, almost flaky, pull-apart texture. Time, patience, and careful attention to detail are the keys to success.	Heat milk and citric acid to 88F in a 7- to 8-quart heavy pot over low heat, stirring occasionally, then maintain a temperature of 88 to 91F on an instant-read thermometer, returning to and removing from heat as necessary, for 1 hour. (Mixture will begin to curdle.)@newline@Dissolve rennet in warm water, then stir into milk mixture. Let stand, uncovered, maintaining 88 to 91F, until the consistency of soft pudding, 15 to 20 minutes.@newline@Using a long knife, make cuts across stiffened milk mixture at 1/2-inch intervals, reaching down to bottom of pot, then make similar cuts in stiffened milk mixture to form a crosshatch pattern (small squares) on top. Let stand, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Keeping temperature between 88 and 91F (reheat when necessary over very low heat), gently stir curds every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, then let curds stand, uncovered and undisturbed, maintaining temperature, 30 minutes more.@newline@Line a large sieve with cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Using a ladle or slotted spoon, transfer curds to center of cheesecloth. Gather sides up over curds to form a sack and tie sides together with a long piece of string as close to curds as possible but without squeezing curds. Suspend sack from a knob or cupboard handle, using string, at least 4 inches from bottom of bowl (sack should not sit in any whey that accumulates; if necessary, discard whey as it accumulates). Let hang 3 hours at room temperature.@newline@Heat a large pot of heavily salted water (1/3 cup salt for 5 quarts water) to 170F. Place one fourth of the curds in a shallow bowl, then ladle about 6 cups hot water over curds and let stand until curds start to meld together, about 2 minutes. Gather curds together with a slotted spoon and remove from water. Working over the bowl of hot water, gently fold the mass of curds over itself in your hands, stretching as you fold. Reheat in hot water as necessary (3 to 5 times) to maintain temperature, folding and stretching until curds become a smooth and elastic disk.@newline@Form into a ball by tucking outside into center, then pinch edges together. Place mozzarella in cool water to cool completely before eating. Make remaining cheese in same manner, reusing hot salted water for subsequent batches.	5
2081	Ricotta Cheesecake	The difference between fresh and commercially prepared ricotta is proven dramatically with this cheesecake. Made with the commercial product, it tastes bland and somewhat grainy. When prepared with fresh ricotta, however, the cake dissolves creamily on the tongue and the ricotta's delicate sweetness shines through clean and true. To further emphasize the ricotta, we keep the other flavors to a minimumjust a smidgen of cinnamon, lemon zest, and vanilla is all you need.	Preheat oven to 325F with rack in lower third.@newline@Lightly butter pan and coat with cookie crumbs, leaving any loose crumbs distributed over bottom of pan.@newline@Whisk together remaining ingredients and pour into crust.@newline@Bake until puffed and golden but center is still slightly wobbly, about 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Cool in pan on a rack (cake will sink a little).@newline@Serve cheesecake warm or at room temperature.	6
2082	Fresh Egg Fettucine	Although this flour, semolina, and egg mixture begins as a stiff dough, it cooks into beautiful, velvety noodles that are as smooth as butter. A pasta machine makes this recipe easy and foolproof. Store-bought fettuccine simply can't compare to homemade.	Make dough: Combine flour and semolina, then mound on a work surface (preferably wooden). Make a well in center and add eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt to well. (Alternatively, put ingredients in a food processor.)@newline@Gradually stir enough flour into eggs (using a fork) to form a paste, pulling in flour closest to egg mixture and being careful not to make an opening in wall of well. Knead remaining flour into mixture with your hands to form a dough (it should be firm and not sticky). Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. (If using a processor, blend about 30 seconds total.)@newline@Cover dough with an inverted bowl and let dough rest 1 hour to make rolling easier.	11
2083	Oranges in Red Wine	The kitchen was the domain of Miraglia Eriquez's grandmother, but this recipe was her grandfather's specialty. Sitting at the dining table, Poppy, as he was known, would peel and cut oranges, toss the pieces into glasses, and cover them with red wine. After the oranges soaked up and sweetened the wine, he would eat forkfuls of the fruit, then down the drink. It wasand isthe perfect prelude to dessert.	Divide oranges among 12 (5-to 8-ounces) juice glasses and top with wine. Let stand 5 minutes.	11
2084	Individual Grape and Vin Santo Cakes	In these tender, elegant cakes, the Italian dessert wine Vin Santo contributes intoxicating flavor that's played up by the addition of plump grapes.	Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle. Generously butter muffin cups and dust with flour, knocking out excess.@newline@Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.@newline@Beat butter with 2/3 cup granulated sugar using an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in zest.@newline@Add flour mixture in 2 batches alternately with wine, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until just incorporated.@newline@Toss grapes with remaining tablespoon flour, then fold into batter.@newline@Divide batter among muffin cups. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Bake until golden and springy to the touch, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then loosen with a knife and remove. Cool to warm, 5 to 10 minutes more.	10
2085	Tony's Negronis	These cocktails are as much fun to drink as they are to say. Tony Oltranti adds freshly squeezed orange juice to a traditional Italian aperitif and serves it straight up in a chilled Martini glass. pSalutep!	Combine all ingredients with ice in shaker. Shake well and strain into chilled Martini glasses.	5
2086	Pizza Margherita	The secret to a great pizza Margherita is to use the best ingredients you can findand to approach them with restraint. (Just because a little cheese is good doesn't mean a lot will be better!) We always start with our all-time favorite pizza dough, adapted from chef Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, in Phoenix. This slightly wet dough, in conjunction with a hot pizza stone, produces a crisp yet chewy crust, the perfect canvas for bright homemade tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and verdant basil leaves.	Make dough: Stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl and let stand until surface appears creamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't appear creamy, discard and start over with new yeast.)@newline@Add 1 1/4 cups flour, remaining 1/2 cup water, salt, and oil and stir until smooth. Stir in enough flour (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for dough to begin to pull away from side of bowl. (Dough will be slightly wet.)@newline@Knead on a floured surface, lightly reflouring when dough becomes too sticky, until smooth, soft, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form into a ball, put in a bowl, and dust with flour. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, about 1 1/4 hours.	4
2087	Panettone Bread Pudding	Store-bought panettone is the foundation of this raisin and bread pudding. Because the bread is so eggy, it bakes into an extra-silky custard that contrasts with a generous expanse of buttery golden brown crispness on top. (Using a shallow pan is key.)	Soak raisins in hot brandy 15 minutes, then drain (discard brandy or reserve for making biscotti; recipe follows).@newline@Meanwhile, butter panettone on both sides and cook in batches in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.@newline@Whisk together remaining ingredients.@newline@Tear panettone into bite-size pieces and spread evenly in a buttered 13-by 9-inch baking dish. Scatter raisins over top, then pour in egg mixture. Let stand 30 minutes.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Bake until pudding is golden and just set, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.	10
2088	Sauted Chicory	Despite her pride in her cultural heritage, Miraglia Eriquez says: "I gotta be honest, some Italians are known for cooking vegetables to death, and I like to keep my greens green." So she boils chicory for only a few minutes to tame its bitterness, then sauts it briefly, keeping the leaves fresh and slightly crisp. This simple, light side dish is great with the hearty pragp -coated pasta.	Wash chicory. Cook in an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water), uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well.@newline@Dry pot, then heat oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook garlic with red-pepper flakes, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute.@newline@Add chicory, stirring to coat. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt.	7
2089	Lemon Pepper Acini di Pepe	This small, round pasta is named for its resemblance to peppercorns, so why not pair it with black pepper, which, along with lemon, adds brightness to the parmesan?	Cook acini di pepe in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water (2 teaspoons salt for 3 quart water) until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.@newline@Melt butter in same pot with oil. Remove from heat and stir in pasta, cheese, zest, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup cooking water (add more to moisten if necessary).	3
2090	Inside-Out Eggplant Parmigiana	In the waste-not mentality of Italian pcucina poverap, panfried patties made with eggs and bread crumbs are a great use for leftover eggplant parmigiana ingredients. In fact, the patties are so incredibly delicious that we made them the crisp showstoppers in this fun reconstruction.	Make tomato sauce: Heat oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, blend tomatoes with juice in a blender until almost smooth. Add to onion mixture in saucepan with water, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil and keep warm, covered.	7
2091	Spaghetti and Meatballs	A heaping platter of spaghetti and meatballs evokes a feeling of comfortperfect for a family get-together. The stars of this dish are the meatballs, of course, and they don't disappointlots of garlic and Parmigiano-Reggiano give them a robust flavor that stands up to the hearty tomato sauce.	Make sauce: Drain tomatoes, reserving juice in a large bowl. Crush tomatoes with your hands and add to juice.@newline@Cook onions in oil in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, 4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Simmer sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt.	10
2092	Rum-Scented Marble Cake	Marble cakes are both homey and festive. A marble cake looks slick when you slice into it and reveal the delicate pattern created when the two batters are swirled together. My first experience working with this type of mixture came about as the result of a marbled chocolate terrine that appeared first in the pages of the old pCook's Magazinep, and then in my chocolate book. Everything about it was rightthe texture, the flavor, the quantity of mixture in relation to the moldeverything, that is, except the marbling. Even when I barely mixed the white and dark chocolate mixtures, what I got was a few streaks of dark and white, and mostly a muddy combined color. After several frustrating attempts, I realized that I had too much dark chocolate mixture and I recast the recipe so there was twice as much white chocolate as dark and the terrine marbled perfectly. So this marble cake is proportioned in the same way: Rather than dividing the base batter in half, I like to remove about one third of it and add the chocolate. Thanks to my old friend Ceri Hadda, who shared her mother's recipe years ago.	1. Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325F (160C).@newline@2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir well by hand to mix. Add the butter. Beat the mixture on low speed with the paddle until the mixture is a smooth, heavy paste, 1 to 2 minutes.@newline@3. Whisk the eggs and rum together. On medium speed, beat 1/3 of the egg mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Beat for 1 minute.@newline@4. Stop and scrape down the bowl and beater. Add half of the egg mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Repeat with the other half.@newline@5. Remove the bowl from the mixer and using a large rubber spatula give the batter a final mix.@newline@6. For the chocolate batter, combine the rum, milk, and baking soda in a medium mixing bowl, Whisk well to dissolve the baking soda. Scrape in the chocolate and whisk it well. Add the 2 cups of base batter to the chocolate mixture and whisk well to combine.@newline@7. Scrape half the remaining base batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Cover with the chocolate batter, making it as even a layer as possible. Finally top with the remaining base batter and smooth the top. Use a wide-bladed table knife or a thin metal spatula to marble the batter: Insert the knife into the batter at the central tube, with the flat side of the blade facing you. Draw the blade through the batter to the bottom of the pan and up and out of the side of the pan closest to you, repeating the motion every inch or so around the pan, making a spiral in the batter, almost as though you were folding egg whites into it. Stop when you get back to the point where you started. Don't bother to smooth the top of the batterit might disturb the marbling.@newline@8. Bake the cake until it is well risen and firm, and a toothpick or a small thin knife inserted midway between the side of the pan and the central tube emerges dry, about 1 hour.@newline@9. Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert a rack over it. Invert and lift off the pan. Cool the cake completely over the rack.	10
2093	Let's Make a Date Muffins	These muffins are inspired by a favorite dessert: sticky toffee pudding. But they are revamped for breakfast and renamed with hope that as you present your beloved with a plate of these, you'll be invited to open your Filofax and check on next Friday night.	To make the streusel topping: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, oats, brown sugar, and pecans. Using a fork, cut in butter until well combined and mixture begins to hold together a bit. Set aside.	1
2094	Clay Pot Chicken with Dates, Sucuk and Bulgur	In Turkish cookery there's a distinctive group of dishes known as pgvep, which take their name from the earthenware pot in which they are cookedin the same way that the tagine does in Morocco. In rural Anatolia the cooking pots may be sealed and buried in the ashes of a fire to cook slowly overnightor, only slightly less romantically, in the local baker's oven. If you don't have a clay pot, a heavy-based cast-iron casserole dish will serve almost as well.p@newline@pGvep dishes encompass all sorts of meat or poultry cooked with legumes, vegetables and fruits. My addition of star anise is not remotely Turkish, but it adds a wonderful layer of aniseed flavor. This pgvep is spicy with a lingering sweetness, so serve it with a light salad or braised wild greens. A dollop of yogurt would also be delicious.p	Preheat the oven to 400F. Heat the butter and extra-virgin olive oil in a heavy-based casserole dish. Gently sweat the onions, garlic, peppers and chiles with the cumin and cinnamon for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables soften. Add the sherry, tomatoes, bulgur, chicken stock, cinnamon, star anise and thyme and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, then cover and simmer gently for 5 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, cut the chickens into quarters and season lightly with salt and pepper.@newline@In another heavy-based frying pan, heat the olive oil over a medium heat and brown the meat lightly all over. Add the sucuk and fry until golden brown on both sides. Transfer the poussins and sucuk to the casserole dish and tuck in the dates. Cover the pan and cook in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning and serve immediately.	3
2095	Cornbread Stuffing Muffins with Ham and Sage	A fun twist on tradition cornbread stuffing molded into muffins.	Preheat oven to 350F. Generously butter twelve 1/3-cup nonstick muffin cups. Divide cornbread cubes and white bread cubes between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Dry slightly in oven, about 5 minutes. Cool. Transfer to large bowl.@newline@Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and celery; cook until soft, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add ham; stir 1 minute. Add all herbs, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; stir to blend. Add vegetable mixture to bread; toss. Add eggs and broth; toss. Let stand 5 minutes; toss again. Spoon about 1/2 cup stuffing mixture into each muffin cup. Press to compact. Mound about 1/2 cup remaining stuffing mixture over stuffing in each muffin cup, pressing to hold shape.@newline@Bake muffins until golden, about 22 minutes. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Using small plastic knife, loosen muffins. Transfer to rack; cool.@newline@DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm uncovered in microwave in 30-second intervals, or covered loosely with foil in 350F oven, about 15 minutes.	8
2096	Chrysanthemum	Camper English, a San Franciscobased writer, adapted this classic drink recipe to showcase the use of absinthe. This drink can be found calling for varying proportions of ingredients in different recipe booksthe brands of absinthe and vermouth chosen will greatly influence the drink's flavor profile.	In cocktail shaker, stir together absinthe, Benedictine liqueur, and vermouth. Add ice and stir for one minute, then strain into martini glass. Squeeze orange peel over drink, making sure oils fall into glass, then drop peel into drink and serve.	11
2097	Abinsthe Frappe	Camper English, a San Franciscobased writer, adapted this classic drink recipe to showcase the use of absinthe. This is basically an easy way to transform the well-known Absinthe Drip into an iced drink. To make the basic Drip, simply add an ounce of absinthe to a glass, set a sugar cube atop a slotted spoon over the glass, and slowly drip icy-cold water over the cube until it dissolves. Those absinthe fountains that you see in old pictures are full of cold water, not absinthe, and allow boozers to dilute the drink to their preferred level. The absinthe in the glass will "louche," or turn cloudy. Add three to five times as much water as absinthe, to taste.	In an old-fashioned glass, combine crushed or cracked ice, absinthe, and simple syrup. Stir until most of the ice melts. For a lighter cocktail, add 2 to 4 tablespoons club soda.	6
2098	Poached Eggs and Parmesan Cheese Over Toasted Brioche with Pistou	PistouFrance's pestogives these simply poached eggs tons of flavor.	Puree basil, garlic, and oil in mini processor until very smooth. Season pistou to taste with salt and pepper.@newline@Add enough water to medium skillet to measure 1 1/4 inches. Sprinkle salt generously into water. Bring water to simmer over medium heat. Crack eggs 1 at a time and gently slip into water. Cook until egg whites are just set and egg yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes.@newline@Place hot toasts on plates. Top each with Parmesan. Using slotted spoon, transfer 2 eggs, well drained, to each piece of brioche. Sprinkle eggs with salt and pepper. Drizzle with some of pistou and serve.	2
2099	Absinthe Sazerac	Camper English, a San Franciscobased writer, developed this adaptation of a classic drink recipe to showcase the use of absinthe. In this case, because absinthe has a very strong flavor, the recipe doesn't call for much. In fact, a large number of cocktails including the Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2, and even some tiki drinks call for just a rinse of absinthe. It is always poured into the glass, swirled, and then discarded. But still, it adds a layer of complexity to the final cocktail.	Fill old-fashioned glass with 1 cup ice and set aside. In second old-fashioned glass, stir together sugar, bitters, and  teaspoon water until sugar is completely dissolved, about 30 seconds. Add rye whiskey and remaining  cup ice, and stir well, at least 15 seconds. From first glass, discard ice, then add absinthe. Holding glass horizontally, roll it between your thumbs and forefingers so that absinthe completely coats the interior, then discard excess. Strain rye whiskey mixture into chilled, absinthe-coated glass. Squeeze lemon peel over drink, making sure oils fall into glass, then drop peel into drink, and serve.	7
2100	Death in the Afternoon	Camper English, a San Franciscobased writer, developed this adaptation of a classic drink recipe to showcase the use of absinthe, but Ernest Hemingway gets credit for the recipe. His advice, circa 1935: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly." We recommend drinking fewer than five. You may also try pouring the absinthe on top insteadsome brands of absinthe will float for a time on the Champagne, and this makes for a nifty visual effect.	Pour absinthe into Champagne flute. Add Champagne until a milky cloud appears, then serve.	12
2101	Chestnut-Armagnac Souffl with Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce	A big, beautiful souffl with a festive chestnut flavor. Youll need to bake the dessert right before serving, but you can make the souffl base (minus the egg whites) two hours ahead, then fold in the whites up to one hour before baking.	Blend chestnuts, 2 tablespoons water, and 1 tablespoon butter in processor until paste forms. Transfer mixture to small bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.@newline@Coat inside of 14-cup souffl dish (about 8 1/4 inches wide and 3 3/4 inches deep) with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle dish with 1/4 cup sugar and tilt to coat bottom and sides evenly.@newline@Whisk 1/4 cup milk, egg yolks, 4 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium bowl to blend. Bring remaining 13/4 cups milk and 4 tablespoons sugar to simmer in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk mixture into yolk mixture. Return custard to same pan. Stir over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chestnut paste, Armagnac, and vanilla and whisk to blend well (some small pieces of chestnut paste will remain). DO AHEAD: Souffl base can be made 2 hours ahead. Press plastic wrap onto surface; let stand at room temperature.@newline@Position rack just below center of oven and preheat to 400F. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 6 tablespoons sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into souffl base in 3 additions. Transfer batter to prepared dish. Place soufflon small baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 hour ahead; let stand at room temperature. Bake souffl until puffed and just firm to touch in center, about 50 minutes. Serve immediately with sauce.@newline@@newline@Peeled cooked chestnuts; sold at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores.@newline@	1
2102	Devil's Food Cake with Peppermint Frosting	The cake is layered with dark chocolate ganache and white chocolate cream, then topped with marshmallowy peppermint frosting.	For cake: Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350F. Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Dust pans with flour; tap out excess. Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in yolk. Add cocoa and beat until well blended. Add flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with ice water in 2 additions, beginning and ending with flour mixture and beating until just blended and smooth after each addition. Divide batter between prepared pans; smooth tops.@newline@Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks 15 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks and cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in foil; store at room temperature.	2
2103	Gingerbread Angels	When it comes to gingerbread, I almost always find that the allspice and cloves overpower the ginger flavor. To remedy that imbalance, I created a cookie with a double dose of ginger (ground and crystallized) and a little bit of cinnamon. And although the traditional cut for gingerbread is fat, sturdy men, I thought the lightness of angel wings seemed more appropriate for these delicate cookies.	Whisk flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, soda, and salt in large bowl. Place crystallized ginger in mini processor; add 1 tablespoon flour mixture and blend until ginger is very finely chopped. Using electric mixer, beat butter in another large bowl until smooth. Add 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in molasses, orange juice, and orange peel (batter may look curdled). Beat in crystallized ginger mixture. Blend in remaining flour-spice mixture. Gather dough together. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill at least 4 hours.@newline@Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Divide dough into 4 portions; shape each into round. Chill 3 rounds. Roll out remaining dough round on floured work surface to generous 1/8-inch thickness. Using floured angel-shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Gather dough scraps and reroll to generous 1/8-inch thickness; cut out more cookies. Using spatula, transfer cookies to sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Brush cookies with glaze, then sprinkle with raw sugar and/or colored sugar, if desired.@newline@Bake cookies until golden, reversing sheets after 7 minutes, about 14 minutes total. Let stand 2 minutes; transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining dough, cooling baking sheets between batches. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container.	11
2104	Christmas Caipirinhas	Inspired by Brazils national cocktail.	Combine lime peel, lime juice, ginger, sugar, and 30 mint leaves in mortar or medium bowl. Using pestle, muddler, or handle of wooden spoon, crush lime peel, ginger, and mint leaves together. Transfer mixture to large pitcher. Stir in rum. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.@newline@Add 3 cups ice cubes to lime mixture in pitcher and stir to blend. Stir in ginger beer. Fill 10 cocktail glasses with ice cubes. Strain or pour cocktail mixture into prepared glasses. Garnish each drink with mint sprig.	7
2105	Warm Chanterelle Salad with Speck and Poached Eggs	Speck, lightly smoked pork that is cured and air-dried, adds a richness to this dish. Look for Speck at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, or online at igourmet.com.	Preheat oven to 500F. Combine 4 tablespoons oil and thyme in large bowl. Press 2 garlic cloves into oil with garlic press; whisk to blend. Add chanterelles and toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.@newline@Spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Spread mushroom mixture on sheet. Roast mushrooms until tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.@newline@Cut Speck crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips.

Drain on paper towels.@newline@Toast ciabatta slices until golden; rub with remaining garlic clove. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Halve each slice lengthwise.@newline@Fill large skillet with water and bring to boil. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Crack eggs, 1 at a time, into custard cup, then slide egg from cup into water; reduce heat to low. Poach eggs until whites are set and yolks are softly set, 3 to 4 minutes.@newline@Meanwhile, toss lettuce and mche with enough vinaigrette to coat. Mound salad on 6 plates. Using slotted spoon, remove eggs from water, dab with paper towels to absorb excess liquid, and place atop salads. Garnish with mushrooms and Speck. Place ciabatta fingers around salad and serve immediately.	2
2106	Sherry Vinegar and Molasses Glazed Carrots	Simple and beautiful. If you cant find small carrots, use medium ones, halved and cut into five-inch pieces.	Melt butter in heavy extra-large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, 1 tablespoon molasses, and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt; saut until carrots are coated with butter mixture, about 1 minute. Add 4 tablespoons Sherry wine vinegar and enough water to almost cover carrots (about 4 cups) and bring to boil. Cover and boil 2 minutes. Uncover and boil until liquid is reduced to syrup and carrots are tender, stirring often, about 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.@newline@Add remaining 1 tablespoon molasses and 2 tablespoons vinegar to carrots and toss over medium-high heat until carrots are heated through and thickly coated with glaze, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon parsley. Season carrots to taste with more coarse salt and generous amount of ground black pepper.

2144	Chile-Rubbed Shrimp with Avocado Corn Cocktail	I've never quite understood the appeal of the traditional shrimp cocktail. I mean, what could be less interesting than cold boiled shrimp dipped in a lackluster mixture of ketchup and prepared horseradish? Here's a shrimp cocktail with gumption, featuring chile-rubbed, grill-seared shrimp served over a colorful, chunky salsa of avocado and sweet corn. You can chill the grilled shrimp before you serve them, but I like the contrast of hot shrimp and cool salsa.	1. Rinse the shrimp under cold running water, then blot them dry with paper towels.@newline@2. Place the chile powder, garlic salt, coriander, oregano, cumin, and pepper in a mixing bowl and whisk to mix. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Stir in the olive oil. Let the shrimp marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour.@newline@3. Cook the shrimp, following the instructions below for any of the grills, until just cooked through. When done the shrimp will turn pinkish white and will feel firm to the touch.@newline@4. Spoon the Avocado and Corn Salsa into 4 large martini glasses or serving bowls. Drape 4 of the hot shrimp over the edge of each glass or bowl and serve at once. Or for a cold shrimp cocktail, let the cooked shrimp cool to room temperature.

2156	Roasted Racks of Lamb with Malagueta Pepper and Farofa Crust	If you're making this entire menu in a single oven, we recommend baking the pyuca gratin ahead; while it cooks, brown the lamb and coat with the sauce and farofa.

2159	Cream Puffs with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce	Profiterolesp@newline@pI've been eating chocolate clairs all my life, which is why pte  chouxbased desserts take me back to my childhood. Cream and chocolate are ideal accompaniments, whether in a cream-filled clair or, as in these profiteroles, in the form of ice cream and warm chocolate sauce.p	Preheat the oven to 450F.@newline@Line one baking sheet with a Silpat and a second one with parchment paper (or line both sheets with parchment if you don't have a Silpat). Set up a heavy-duty mixer with the paddle attachment.@newline@Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, add the flour all at once, and stir rapidly with a stiff heatproof or wooden spoon until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and the bottom of the pan is clean, with no dough sticking to it. The dough should be glossy and smooth but still damp.@newline@Enough moisture must evaporate from the dough to allow it to absorb more fat when the eggs are added. Continue to stir for about 5 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent the dough from coloring. A thin coating will form on the bottom and sides of the pan. When enough moisture has evaporated, steam will rise from the dough and there will be the nutty aroma of cooked flour.@newline@Immediately transfer the dough to the mixer bowl and mix for a few seconds to release some of the heat from the dough. With the mixer on medium speed, add 4 eggs, one at a time, beating until each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one; scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Turn off the machine. Lift some of the dough on a rubber spatula, then turn the spatula to let it run off: It should fall off the spatula very slowly; if it doesn't move at all or is very dry and falls off in one clump, beat in the additional egg.@newline@Place the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 15 disks (this will give you 3 extras for testing) about 1 1/2 inches across and just under 1/2 inch thick on the Silpat-lined baking sheet, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between them, as they will expand when baked. Pipe the remainder on the other sheet. (You will have about 4 dozen in all.) Bake the 15 puffs for the recipe and freeze the ones on the second baking sheet until firm, then transfer to a freezer container and freeze for another time.@newline@Bake the puffs for 10 minutes, turn the sheet around, turn the oven down to 350F, and bake 15 minutes more. Remove one puff and break it open: It should be hollow inside and not gooey or eggy; if it is still moist, return it to the oven and check in 5 minutes. Cool the puffs completely on the baking sheet. Store in an airtight container until serving time.	11
2160	Almond Cake with Roasted Pineapple and Vanilla Cream	TREND: Roasted fruitp@newline@pWHO: Diane Rossen Worthington, author of pThe Taste of the Season: Inspired Recipes for Fall and Winterp	For cake: Preheat oven to 350F.

Serve with sour cream.Occasionally stir mixture left in the bowl during the process of spooning latkes into the pan.	5
2162	Tacos Al Pastor	The meat for these shepherds tacos is commonly seen roasting on vertical spits displayed with pride on street stands throughout Mexico. The spits are usually topped with a pineapple, which is thinly sliced and served in the tacos. This method of cooking meat is identical to that used for the spit-roasted lamb (shawarma) brought to Puebla, Mexico, by Lebanese immigrants in the 1930s. The technique was copied by the Mexican taqueros (taco masters), who substituted pork for lamb. The original stand for tacos al pastor still exists in Puebla, with vertical spits of pork still revolving in front of its huge wood-burning hearth. This recipe makes two dozen tacos to serve 8 persons with big appetites, or more as part of a taco party platter. Note that the pork must marinate overnight before cooking.	Stem, seed, and rehydrate the dried chiles (page 153). Drain and set aside, reserving the soaking liquid.@newline@In a small saucepan, simmer the orange juice over medium-low heat until reduced by half; set aside. In the jar of a blender, puree the rehydrated chiles until smooth, adding some of the soaking water, if needed, to achieve a smooth consistency.@newline@In a large bowl, add the reduced orange juice, pureed chiles, orange zest, brown sugar, garlic, cumin, oregano, salt, black pepper, vinegar, lime juice, cola, and beer and stir to mix well. Add the pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.@newline@When ready to cook, remove the pork from the marinade and drain well. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Saut the pork pieces until the meat is cooked through, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve right away or keep warm in the pan until ready to serve.@newline@To serve, lay the tortillas side by side, open face and overlapping on a platter. Divide the filling equally between the tortillas and top with pineapple and salsa. Grab, fold, and eat right away. Or build your own taco: lay a tortilla, open face, in one hand. Spoon on some filling, top with pineapple and salsa, fold, and eat right away.	12
2163	Mint Syrup	Season: June to August. I cant help feeling that we should all make more use of garden mint. Im sure that if it didnt run amok in the garden in a rather annoying way, we would prize it more highly not just as a nice thing to chuck in with the potatoes, but as the wonderful sweet-scented herb that it is. This simple recipe is best made with young, bright green mint leaves picked just before flowering, when the volatile oils are at their strongest. Gather them on a sunny day, when the plant is fully dry and the leaves are warm. Use the leaves immediately after picking to retain every bit of their amazing warming and cooling menthol character. Mix 2 teaspoons of mint syrup into a glass of ice-cold water, lemonade, or tonic for a cooling summer drink. To make delicious hot, sweet mint tea, add 1 tablespoon of the syrup to a pot (silver, of course, if you have one) of steaming green tea.	Check the mint leaves for any insect life, then tear the leaves into shreds. Put the lemon juice into a large bowl. Add the mint and pound with the end of a wooden rolling pin. Add the sugar and salt and continue to crush the mint leaves to release their menthol essence. Leave to macerate for 8 to 10 hours or overnight.@newline@Pour 2 1/2 cups of boiling water over the macerated mint mixture and let stand for a further 12 hours.@newline@Strain the syrup through a very fine sieve or cheesecloth into a saucepan. Gently bring to a simmer and simmer for a couple of minutes. Pour into warm, sterilized bottles (see p. 125) and seal with screw-caps or corks.@newline@This syrup will keep unopened for 4 months, but once opened, it should be stored in the fridge. If you want to keep it longer, it will need to be sterilized in a water bath straight after canning (see p. 125).	4
2164	Red Wine-Raspberry Sorbet	If you don't believe the saying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, this simple yet incredibly good sorbet is proof positive that it can be true. This is my all-time favorite sorbet.	In a medium saucepan, bring the sugar, water, and red wine to a boil and let boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and add the raspberries. Cover and let steep for 1 hour. To pure the berries and remove the seeds, using a rubber spatula, press the mixture through a mesh strainer set over a medium bowl or pass it through a food mill fitted with a fine disk into a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions.	2
2165	Grilled Stuffed Peppers	Stuffed peppers come out well on the grill if you don't make them too big. I like to mix ground meats and season the stuffed peppers heavily. Be sure to cook a little of the meat mixture to test the seasonings before you stuff the peppers, since the salt and spice levels of the various sausage meats and seasoning mixes vary widely.	Mix the seasoning blend, salt, and wine in a small bowl and stir well. Then combine the mixture with all the other ingredients except the oil and peppers in a mixing bowl and mash with your hands until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Put the meat in the refrigerator for an hour or more to allow the flavors to blend.@newline@Heat a little oil in a frying pan and place a teaspoon of the meat mixture in the hot oil. Cook, turning frequently, until done on both sides. Taste, and adjust the salt and seasonings in the remaining meat mixture.@newline@Cut the peppers in half through the stem so that they form six half-pepper cups. Fill each half pepper with meat mixture. Mound the meat no more than a 1/2 inch over the top edge of each pepper. The stuffed peppers can be made in advance to this point and stored covered in the refrigerator for several days.@newline@Light the grill. Cook pepper side down over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, until the pepper is charred and soft. Turn the stuffed peppers over and cook on the meat side for 10 minutes. Test for doneness. Serve immediately with your choice of salsas. These are also great cold or cut into slices for sandwiches.	9
2166	Persian New Year's Soup with Beans, Noodles, and Herbs (Ash-e-reshteh)	This countrified soup is often served in late March for Norooz, the Persian new year. With beans, vegetables, noodles, and yogurt, it is a meal in itself. If you can't find fava beans, use limas. Start this recipe the night before to soak the chickpeas, kidneys beans, and fava beans. Boil them in a pot with four cups of water for one minute, then turn off the heat and add a splash of apple cider vinegar. Cover the pot and let them soak overnight	Dice 1 of the onions. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and add 4 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onion and saut until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, kidney beans, and fava beans, and add them to the onion along with 4 of the minced cloves of garlic, the turmeric, and lentils. Saut for 1 minute, then add the stock and bring to a boil. Boil the beans, covered, for 1 hour. Tilt the lid so the pot is partially covered and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt. Slice the remaining 2 onions into thin half moons. Heat a saut pan over high heat and add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions and fry, stirring frequently, until the onions are brown and caramelized. Add the remaining garlic and the mint and saut for 1 minute. Season with salt and set aside.@newline@Add the noodles to the soup and cook until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. When the noodles are almost done, add the leafy greens and the fresh herbs and cook for 2 minutes. Serve with a large dollop of yogurt and a few tablespoons of the sauted onion mixture.	9
2167	Sweet Potato Souffl	This is a nice variation on regular sweet potatoes for a Thanksgiving side dish. It's almost a dessert, it's so sweet!	Preheat the oven to 400F. Grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with butter.@newline@On a foil-covered baking sheet, bake the sweet potatoes for 1 hour, or until they are soft. When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes, place the flesh in a large mixing bowl, and mash until very smooth. Add the eggs, sugar, butter, vanilla, milk, and salt. Combine well with an electric mixer or hand mixer. Turn the mixture into the baking dish.@newline@In a medium bowl, stir together the pecans, brown sugar, flour, and butter until thoroughly combined. Spoon the mixture over the sweet potatoes, making an even layer. Bake the casserole for 30 minutes, or until slightly browned. Let the casserole sit for 5 minutes before serving.	8
2168	Brioche	This classic French bread is rich and slightly sweet, with a soft, golden crust and a yellow, buttery, cakey crumb. It is widely eaten in France  with coffee for breakfast, as a roll with dinner, or as a base for any number of desserts. At River Cottage, we like to toast brioche and serve it with a smooth chicken liver pt and a little fruit jelly. Contrary to popular belief, as bread goes, brioche is pretty straightforward. The dough is very soft to handle though, so kneading in a stand mixer is easier. You can make and bake brioche all in one day, but it benefits from sitting overnight in the fridge  the very soft dough stiffens as it chills, making it easier to shape.	To knead by hand: Mix together all the dough ingredients in a large bowl to form a dough. Knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and shiny.@newline@Or, to use a stand mixer: Fit the dough hook and add all the dough ingredients to the mixer bowl. Mix on low speed until combined and mix for about 10 minutes, until smooth and shiny.@newline@Shape the dough into a round, place in a bowl, and cover tightly. Leave in the fridge overnight.@newline@The next day, divide the dough into 2 pieces and form into the shape of your choice. Lightly flour the loaves, lay them on a wooden board or linen cloth, and cover with a plastic bag. Leave them somewhere nice and warm to proof until almost doubled in size; this could take 3 or 4 hours, as the dough is cold.@newline@Preheat the oven to 400F. For the glaze, beat the egg and milk together. Transfer the risen loaves to a baking sheet and brush all over with the glaze. Bake for about 10 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 350F and bake for a further 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack.	5
2169	Book-Club Buck	NoDescription	Pour the sherry, simple syrup , and lime juice into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake well (until condensation forms on the entire shaker). Strain the mixture into a rocks glass filled with ice. Top with the club soda. Place the lime peel in the glass.	10
2170	Golden Beet Salad	Salads need not focus on the lettuce. Here the greens take a back seat to vibrant golden beets. The salty, creamy blue cheese and the crunchy walnuts complement the sweet beets. Roasting the beets in water prevents them from drying out.	Preheat the oven to 400F.@newline@Place the beets in a roasting pan and add water to a depth of 1/2 inch. Cover the pan with foil and bake until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 hours. Set the beets aside until they are cool enough to handle. Peel and rinse off any pieces of skin. Slice the beets into 1/2-inch-thick rounds, and then cut them into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. Let the beets cool to room temperature.@newline@Toss the beets with the rice vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add the olive oil and mustard and toss with the spinach. Garnish with the toasted walnuts and crumbled blue cheese.@newline@Make Ahead: You can roast the beets up to 3 days in advance; toss them just before serving.	8
2171	Viet-Mex Fajita Rolls	At Matt's Rancho Martinez in Dallas, they have an appetizer called fried avocados. The deep-fried wedges are served with romaine lettuce "taco shells," cilantro, slivers of carrots and jicama, and other fixin's. "I got the idea from Vietnamese restaurants," said Marco Martinez, son of the late Matt Martinez Jr. "The lettuce rolls are great for people on the Atkins diet, too; they put their fajitas on them. We use soy sauce on the fajitaswe borrow lots of things from Asian cooking." Making Viet-Mex salad rolls is sort of like making lettuce tacos. Put all the ingredients out on the table and let everybody "roll their own."	Put hot sliced beef on a platter surrounded by the cilantro, tomato, avocado, green onions, carrots, jicama, peanuts, and limes. Use lettuce leaves to roll up steak slices with the other ingredients. Drizzle with lime juice just before serving.	4
2172	Scones	Of course you can put what you like on your scones, but I'll usually opt for a traditional cream tea of jam and clotted cream. Cream tea etiquette is fiercely disputed in the West Country. The Cornish put strawberry jam on their scones first, then the clotted cream; in Devon and Dorset, it is customary to do it the other way around. Personally, I prefer raspberry jam and I always put jam on first, even though I live on the Devon-Dorset border.	Preheat the oven to 400F. Using a food processor if you have one, whiz together the flour, baking powder, salt, butter, and sugar until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. (Otherwise, sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl, rub in the butter with your fingers, then stir in the sugar.)@newline@In a separate bowl, beat together the egg, vanilla, and cream, then add to the flour mixture and bring together with your hands to form a soft dough.@newline@Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead very briefly, for 10 seconds or so, to make it a little smoother. Now, using a little more flour, pat or gently roll out to a thickness of about 1 1/2 inches.@newline@Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter (or a larger one, if you like), cut out about 8 disks of dough  pressing the cutter straight down, rather than twisting it, as this gives the scones a better chance of rising straight up.@newline@Lay the disks on a lightly greased baking sheet, brush the tops with milk, and bake for about 15 minutes, or a little longer if the scones are large. To check that they are cooked, insert a wooden toothpick into the middle; it should come out clean.@newline@Transfer to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes, then serve warm.	11
2173	Hills Family Sugar Cookie Cutouts	NoDescription	Sift the flour with baking powder and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter for a full minute, then add the sugar and beat at medium speed until light, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy and very light, another 2 to 4 minutes. With a wooden spoon gradually work the flour into the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into two portions and wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least several hours or overnight.@newline@Heat the oven to 400. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick, using more flour for the rolling pin, sprinkled on the dough, and additionally on the floured surface as needed to prevent sticking. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters and place on cookie sheets.@newline@This dough works beautifully if gathered and rerolled; if it gets too soft, chill for about 15 minutes.@newline@Refrigerate or freeze the cut-out cookies on their baking sheets for 10 to 15 minutes so they will retain their firm edges as they bake; if you're in a hurry, go ahead and bake the cookies immediately. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until cookies are puffed and only just barely starting to brown at the edges: Start with the shortest amount of time and watch carefully, especially with very small cookies. As the cookies are fragile right out of the oven, let cool slightly before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.@newline@When cool, glaze and decorate as desired.@newline@Makes up to 6 dozen cookies, depending on the size. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.	2
2174	Candied Orange Sticks	Season: Anytime. I like to make several batches of these sweets in November or early December. A dozen or so, wrapped in cellophane, are a charming gift. Needless to say, you dont need to stop at oranges: lemon and grapefruit peel work equally well, and you can use milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate for dipping. The corn syrup is optional, but does prevent the sticks from becoming too hard. It is best to keep the candied sticks in an airtight container and only dip them in chocolate shortly before you want them.	Scrub the oranges, then remove the peel in quarters. To do this, cut through the peel with a sharp knife, going right around the orange, starting and finishing at the stem end, then repeat at a right angle to the first cut. Remove the peel, with the attached pith, from the fruit. Weigh out 9 ounces of peel and cut it into slices measuring about 1/4 by 2 inches.@newline@Put the orange peel slices into a large pan and cover with 8 cups of cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and return to the pan with 4 cups of cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved (it wont take long). Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 24 hours.@newline@Bring the pan to a boil again. Add the corn syrup, if using, and boil gently, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated and the orange sticks are coated with bubbling orange syrup. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Using a pair of tongs (or your fingers), carefully remove the orange sticks and place on a wire rack with a tray underneath to catch the drips. Leave in a warm place for 24 hours, or place in a very low oven at approximately 140F for 2 to 3 hours to dry.@newline@Break the chocolate into pieces, put into a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and leave until melted. Remove from the heat. Dip one half of each orange stick in the melted chocolate and place on a sheet of parchment or waxed paper to dry.@newline@Before dipping, the sticks will keep well for 3 to 4 months. Once they have their chocolate coating, they are best eaten within 3 weeks.	7
2175	Chicken Pizza	NoDescription	Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@Roll the pizza dough out and fit onto two 15-inch pizza pans. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of garlic on each pizza crust, followed by 1/2 cup each of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese. Scatter half of the bell pepper, sliced onion, chicken, and bacon on top of the cheeses.@newline@Sprinkle another 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese over each pizza and drizzle each pizza with 1 tablespoon more of olive oil. Bake the pizzas for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crusts are lightly browned. Slice each pizza into 8 pieces.	11
2176	Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage	We hit upon our favorite recipe a few summers back, when we helped out a buddy with his annual Labor Day pig roast in Connecticut. In addition to the 125-pound porker we were planning to serve, we decided we should have some chicken just in case not everyone at the party wanted to partake of the sacred swine. We got about 100 birds, halved them, and soaked them in a simple marinade of just lemon, sage, and cracked black pepper. It turned out to be one of the first timesmaybe the only timethere was a pig roast where chicken was the hit of the day. What really made it special was the marinade. It lent a nice acidity to the meat, which became really tender, and the sage and lemon flavors just exploded. For the most classic presentation, roast a whole bird and carve it tableside. If you want an especially crispy, golden-skinned chicken, have your butcher halve it, and roast the halves skin side up so they can self-baste as they roast.	Put the chicken in a large bowl. Add the oil, lemon, and sage; toss well. Cover tightly and transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 24 hours.@newline@The next day, let the chicken stand at room temperature for 30 minutes while the oven preheats to 450F.@newline@Sprinkle the chicken inside and out with the seasoning. Remove the lemon slices and sage from the marinade and stuff them inside the chicken cavity. Scatter the carrots, celery, and onion, if using, over the bottom of a roasting pan. Pour just enough water into the pan to cover the bottom. Arrange the chicken, breast side up, on top of the vegetables, if desired, or place the chicken on a roasting rack over the vegetables.@newline@Transfer the pan to the center oven rack; roast for 20 minutes. Baste with the pan juices, and continue roasting, basting once or twice, for 25 minutes more (if the chicken is not golden brown all over at this point, continue to cook for 10 more minutes).@newline@Reduce the heat to 325F. Finish roasting, without basting, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165F, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Let the chicken stand for 5 minutes before carving. Serve with the pan juices and vegetables, if desired.	2
2177	French Macaroons with Raspberry-Rose Buttercream	To create patisserie-perfect macaroons, Sandra Holl uses very finely ground almond flour. To remove the larger pieces, sift the flour before using.	Cookies Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Sift powdered sugar, almond flour, and hazelnut flour (if using) into large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, sugar, and pinch of salt in medium bowl until medium peaks form. Add egg white mixture to almond mixture; fold to incorporate. Working in 2 batches, fill pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch-diameter plain pastry tip with batter (batter will be thin and will drip from bag). Pipe batter in 11/4-inch rounds on baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart (cookies will spread slightly). Let rest on sheets at room temperature 20 minutes. Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 375F. Bake cookies 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325F. Continue to bake cookies until puffed and golden on top, about 10 minutes, reversing sheets after 5 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets on rack. Carefully peel cookies from parchment. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.	5
2178	Whoopie Pies with Mint Filling and Chocolate Ganache	Trish Newcomb makes her Granville Gourmet Whoopie Pies with shortening, but the cookies and filling can also be made with butter. In the pBon Apptitp Test Kitchen we added a layer of chocolate ganache for a more intense chocolate flavor.	Cookies: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat shortening, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla in large bowl until well blended, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with milk in 2 additions, beating until blended after each addition.@newline@Drop dough by very rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are slightly puffed and spread but are still soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on sheets 10 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to racks and cool completely. Repeat with remaining cookie dough. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight in single layer at room temperature.	8
2179	Heaven-and-Earth Tempura Cakes	Ten Chi Kaki Agp@newline@pThe name of this dish, Heaven and Earth, is a euphemism for kitchen scraps, namely the tops (heaven) and bottoms (earth) of produce: tender, leafy celery tops; tougher leek tops; mushroom stems; carrot and daikon peels; stubby ends of lotus and burdock root, parsnips, rutabagas, and bitter melon. All sorts of neglected or remaindered vegetable bits can be transformed into lovely, lacy-crisp, colorful tempura pancakes.p@newline@pThe key to making tasty pancakes from disparate ingredients is to select items that cook at approximately the same temperature and time. Cutting your vegetables so that most are long and thin and a few are in crescents or rounds will make it easier to form a cohesive mass. Dusting ingredients with cornstarch before adding them to the batter will also help the pancakes hold together.p@newline@pWhen you are ready to form the pancakes, use a large, flat stainless-steel spoon or ladle to help shape them. Dipping the spoon or ladle into hot oil first will ensure easy release of the pancake as you slip it into the oil.p@newline@pAnother bit of advice: pgamanp, which translates as "reticence" or "reluctance." Refraining from taking action is often considered a virtue in both the Japanese kitchen and Japanese society at large. My recipe instructs you not to take certain actions, though you may it tough to follow such advice.p	Depending upon seasonal availability, choose to make either the winter pancakes or the summer pancakes: To make the winter pancakes, place the red onion in a bowl. With a pastry brush, dust the slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch. Pull gently to separate the crescent shapes, dusting again with a bit more cornstarch. Add the carrot and sweet potato peels to the bowl and dust with the remaining cornstarch. Toss to distribute the vegetables evenly.@newline@To make the summer pancakes, with a pastry brush, dust the bitter melon slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch, then place them in a bowl. Dust the zucchini slices and kabocha peels in a similar manner and add them to the bowl; toss to distribute evenly. Dust the shredded shiso leaves and chives with cornstarch and add them to the bowl; toss again to distribute evenly.@newline@Make the batter just before frying: Place the ice cubes in a small bowl with half of the water. Sift the cake flour over the water and stir to mix slightly; there should still be lumps. If needed, add water, a few drops at a time, until the batter is the consistency of a thin pancake batter.@newline@Pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches into a small wok or small, deep skillet. Add the sesame oil and heat slowly. Check the temperature with an unvarnished long wooden chopstick (or a bamboo skewer). Small bubbles will form around the tip when the oil is about 350F. Wait for about 45 seconds longer to allow the temperature to rise a bit moreto about 370Fand then test the oil temperature with a few drops of batter. If they sink slightly, then rise to the surface and puff quickly but do not color, the oil is ready. You may need to fry the pancakes in batches to avoid crowding them in the pan. Preheat the oven to 200F for keeping the cooked pancakes warm.@newline@Spoon a bit of the batter over the cornstarch-dusted vegetables and toss lightly to coat the vegetables with the batter. Dip a large spoon or ladle into the hot oil. Place one-eighth of the vegetable mixture in the bowl of the oil-dipped spoon. Carefully tilt the spoon to slide the pancake into the hot oil, aiming to make a disk about 2 inches in diameter. The batter and cornstarch act as "glue" to keep the vegetable slivers together. Repeat to make more pancakes, being careful not to crowd the pan.@newline@Most important, refrain from touching the pancakes for a full 30 seconds after you place them in the oil. It will seem like an eternity, but gaman will yield the best results. If wayward bits are strewn at the edges of your pan, carefully pick them up and place them on top of the still-moist pancake batter in the center. (Skill with long chopsticks will be well rewarded, though a long-handled fine-mesh skimmer can scoop beneath as well.) If the center of the pancake is very dry, dip the wayward bits in some fresh batter before "gluing" them in place. When the batter in the center of the disk seems barely moist, carefully invert the pancake.@newline@After flipping, allow the pancakes to fry undisturbed for about 1 minute, or until crisp. Using cooking chopsticks or a skimmer, remove the pancakes from the oil and place them on a rack set over a baking sheet to drain. If frying in batches, place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the fried pancakes warm. Use the skimmer to clear the oil of batter bits between batches.@newline@When all of the pancakes are fried, transfer them to paper towels to absorb any additional surface oil.	5
2180	Candied Sweet Potato	Daigaku Imop@newline@pHanamaru Marketp, a highly successful, long-running Japanese television talk show, opens with a short cooking segment every weekday morning. Finding ways to make impressive classic cuisine simpler and less technically demanding is the theme of many of the episodes. In the autumn of 2008, one of the broadcasts featured an innovative recipe for pdaigaku imop (candied sweet potatoes) that topped all previous viewer-rating charts. Indeed, as of this writing, nearly a year later, it remains the all-time favorite.p	Combine the sugar, vegetable oil, water, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt in a skillet just large enough to hold the sweet potato chunks in a single layer. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Arrange the sweet potatoes in the pan in a single layer and cover with a circle of parchment paper to keep the surface moist. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Cover the skillet with a lid (keep the parchment in place) and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. A toothpick inserted into the thickest part of a piece should meet no resistance. If the chunks are not yet tender, add a bit more water and simmer for another minute or two. Check to make sure the sugar doesn't burn.@newline@Once the potatoes are tender, remove the lid and parchment and jiggle the skillet to allow the potato chunks to roll around in the rapidly reducing glaze (the vinegar, by the way, will keep the sugar from seizing after the glaze has cooled). After 6 minutes or so, the water and oil in the skillet will have separated and most of the water will have evaporated, enabling you to remove the lightly glazed sweet potato chunks with little or no oil clinging to them.@newline@Transfer the glazed chunks to a plate, spreading them out in a single layer. Sprinkle with the black sesame seeds. Let cool to room temperature before serving. They keep at cool room temperature for 6 to 8 hours. If you will be keeping them longer, place them in a covered container and refrigerate for up to 2 days. For optimal texture, bring the potatoes back to room temperature before serving.	10
2181	Lamb Bulgogi with Asian Pear Dipping Sauce	Bulgogip (grilled marinated beef) is a traditional Korean dish. Here, lamb stands in for the steak. The meat is served with lettuce leaves and other veggies, hot pepper paste, and a slightly sweet dipping sauce. Guests use all of the ingredients to assemble their own lettuce wraps, which is a common practice in Korean restaurants. Timing note: The lamb needs to marinate for at least four hours.	For lamb: Place green onions, sugar, chopped garlic, and sliced ginger in processor and blend until finely chopped, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Add soy sauce, mirin, Asian sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, and black pepper; whisk marinade to blend. Pour 1 cup marinade into 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Open boned leg of lamb like book; add to baking dish, arranging in single layer. Pour remaining marinade over lamb, spreading to cover evenly. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 1 day, turning lamb occasionally.	4
2182	Planked Beef Fillets with Porcini Slather	This is one of our favorite ways to plank meat, especially boneless steaks and chops. We grill one side of the meat to give it the direct flame and char that tastes and looks so good, then we slide the uncooked side of the steak directly onto the plank. The result is a great contrast in textures, with the seared crisp char on one side and the tender woodsiness on the other side. We also add smoke flavor to this recipe, but you can omit the smoke if you want. The porcini slather makes a little more than 3/4 cup, and it will keep refrigerated for up to 1 week. You will need only half of it for this recipe, so save the rest to use another time on pork chops or chicken. It's also great as a dipping sauce for bread.p@newline@pSuggested plank:p 1 cedar or oak grilling plank, soaked in water for at least 1 hourp	Method 1. To make the slather, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir to blend well.@newline@2. Prepare an indirect fire in your grill, with a hot fire on one side and no fire on the other. For a charcoal grill, soak 1 cup wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes and place directly on the hot coals when ready to plank. For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.@newline@3. Sear the steaks over the hot fire for 3 or 4 minutes on one side, and then place the steaks on the plank, uncooked side down. Top each fillet with about 1 tablespoon of the slather.@newline@4. Place the plank on the indirect side of the grill. Close the lid and cook until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 130F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.@newline@Oven-Smoke Planking: Preheat the oven to 400F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Meanwhile, in a medium-hot skillet, sear the tenderloin on all sides. When the smoke begins to fill the oven, place the seared steaks on the plank in the middle of the oven. Oven-plank for 20 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers about 130F for medium-rare.	2
2183	Cedar-Planked Char with Wood-Grilled Onions	Small whole fish like trout, char, walleye, bass, and even lake perch are excellent for planking, especially smoke-planking. They get the flavor of the wood plank on one side and a burnished golden color and smoky flavor on the other. An indirect fire is used to slowly cook the whole fish through. Char, in flavor and texture a cross between trout and salmon, is best planked whole. It's easier to fillet after it is cooked and stays moister that way. This method can be used with fish fillets and steaks, too. Whenever you grill fish, grill lemon halves alongside. The little bit of browning adds flavor, and the heat makes the lemons burst with juice.p@newline@pSuggested plank:p 2 cedar grilling planks, soaked in water for at least 1 hourp	Method 1. Prepare an indirect fire in your grill with a hot fire on one side and no fire on the other. For a charcoal grill, soak 1 cup wood chips or corncobs in water for at least 30 minutes and place directly on the hot coals when ready to plank. For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.@newline@2. In the cavity of each fish, place 2 sprigs each of tarragon, dill, and parsley, and 2 stems of chives. Season with salt and pepper. Place 2 fish on each plank.@newline@3. Brush the cut sides of the lemons and onions with olive oil.@newline@4. When you see the first wisp of smoke, place the planks on the indirect side of the grill. Set the onion and lemon halves, cut side down, directly on the grate over the fire and close the lid.@newline@5. Check the lemons after 2 or 3 minutes. If they have nice grill marks, remove them from the grill. The onions will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes and may be turned after the first 10 to 12 minutes. When they are nicely charred, remove them from the grill, too. Close the lid and continue to cook the fish until it is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes total.@newline@6. Fillet the char and serve on a platter with the lemon and onion halves.@newline@Oven Smoke-Planking: Preheat the oven to 400F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Place the herb-stuffed planked fish in the middle of the oven. Oven smoke-plank for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork. Garnish with lemon wedges. (Omit the onions.)	7
2184	Pork Chops Yucatn-Style	The inspiration for this recipe comes from ppoc chucp, a grilled pork dish from Mexico's Yucatn region. Brining the pork chops prevents the meat from drying out on the grill.	Stir water, kosher salt, bay leaves, allspice, and black peppercorns in medium bowl until salt dissolves for brine. Arrange pork chops in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish. Pour brine over. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour, turning occasionally.	2
2185	Nojito	This is a great twist on the pmojitopthe rustic sugarcane and rum drink of old Havana given its name in the 1930s by Sloppy Joe's bar in Key West. Here there's no rum, but the immense flavor remains. However, in this incarnation, I make it a bit differently. Not wanting a lot of little mint pieces in my teeth, I've created it so that the mint flavor gets infused beforehand; I then garnish the drink with a few mint leaves for added decoration and flavor.	Muddle the mint leaves in a cocktail shaker with the lime juice and sugar. Add ice cubes to fill a shaker and pour in the club soda. Gently shake a few times to incorporate (remember: club soda is fizzy).@newline@Strain into a medium or tall cocktail glass filled with ice. Garnish, if desired.	11
2186	Eggs with Tomato on Toast	NoDescription	Separate the eggs, reserving each yolk in its shell and combining 2 whites in a cup. Refrigerate the remaining 2 whites for another use.@newline@In a cold medium skillet, combine the oil, garlic, peperoncini, and oregano. Turn on the heat and warm over medium-high heat until the garlic begins to fry (without browning) and the mixture becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes.@newline@Raise the heat to high, then use your hands to crush each tomato into the pan, allowing the juice to fall into the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Fry the tomatoes, continuing to break them up with the fork. Cook until they concentrate and no longer look watery, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the basil.@newline@Lower the heat to medium and stir in the egg whites. Cook until the whites become opaque and firm, thickening the tomato sauce, about 1 minute.@newline@Turn off the heat. Using the back of a spoon, make 4 indentations in the sauce, allowing a few inches around each. Slip an egg yolk into each indentation. Draw the sauce in from the edges of the pan around each of the yolks. Cover the skillet and leave it on the stove, heat off, until the yolks are just warmed through and beginning to set, about 3 minutes for runny yolks.@newline@Gently spoon some sauce and a yolk onto each piece of toast and serve immediately. I find rubbing some olive oil on the spoon helps prevent breaking the yolk.	11
2187	Roasted Pork with Sage, Rosemary, and Garlic	Pork loin is a lean, mild cut of meat. I like to add flavor and keep it moist by stuffing it with a mixture of chopped herbs and garlic. Simply make a small channel in the center of the loin with a knife, then poke the stuffing in. The meat will be flavored and basted from within while it roasts.	Preheat the oven to 375F. Using a long knife with a thin blade or a clean sharpening steel, make a channel lengthwise through the center of the loin running from one end to the other.@newline@Mix the chopped sage and rosemary in a small bowl. Add the minced garlic and 1 tablespoon oil. Season the mixture with salt and pepper, then poke it through the channel in the meat (I find it easiest to work from both ends more or less at once).@newline@Season the outside of the loin generously with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat in an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the loin. Brown the meat on all sides and on each end, about 8 minutes in all.@newline@Add the herb sprigs and crushed garlic to the pan and put it in the oven. Roast for 15 minutes, then turn the loin and roast 15 minutes more, basting from time to time with the pan drippings.@newline@Remove the pan from the oven, cover with foil, and set aside in a warm place for 15 minutes to rest the meat. To serve, cut the loin into generous slices, season with sea salt, and drizzle with the pan juices.	12
2188	Phyllo Pizza with Smoked Mozzarella and Cherry Tomatoes	NoDescription	Preheat oven to 400F. Toss tomatoes, olive oil, salt, and oregano in medium bowl. Scatter tomatoes on large rimmed baking sheet; roast until soft and beginning to collapse, about 22 minutes. Remove from oven and let tomato mixture cool. Maintain oven temperature.@newline@Place stack of phyllo sheets on work surface and cover with plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.@newline@Brush another large rimmed baking sheet with some of melted butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet on baking sheet. Brush lightly with melted butter and top with second phyllo sheet. Brush with butter and top with third sheet; brush with butter. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Repeat 3 more times for total of 12 phyllo sheets and 4 tablespoons Parmesan. Sprinkle stacked phyllo sheets with grated mozzarella, leaving 1/2-inch plain border. Top with roasted tomatoes, pepper strips, and olives.@newline@Bake pizza until phyllo is crisp, 25 to 27 minutes. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons fresh oregano over, loosen pizza from sheet with large metal spatula, and slide onto cutting board.	12
2189	Bacon, Lettuce, and Cherry Tomato Salad with Aioli Dressing	Accompany this salad version of a BLT sandwich with grilled bread.	Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until crisp; transfer to paper towels. Crumble bacon coarsely. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet; reserve skillet.@newline@Place lettuce and tomatoes in large serving bowl. Heat bacon drippings in skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, then mayonnaise and vinegar; whisk until blended, 30 to 40 seconds. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over lettuce and tomatoes and toss to coat. Sprinkle bacon over. Serve immediately.	4
2190	Chilled Watercress-Spinach Soup	NoDescription	Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add leeks and potato; saut until leeks are slightly softened but not brown, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Add watercress and spinach; stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Cool slightly.@newline@Working with 1 cup at a time, puree soup in blender until smooth. Transfer soup to large bowl. Stir in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Thin with more broth, if desired.@newline@Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish center of each with hard-boiled eggs and small watercress sprigs.	9
2191	Crisp Rosemary Flatbread	Think of it as a cracker version of rosemary-flecked flatbread. But these are the easiest crackers you'll ever make: Rather than cutting the dough into small pieces, you bake three large pieces, then break them into smaller ones to serve. The jagged edges invite nibbling.	Preheat oven to 450F with a heavy baking sheet on rack in middle.@newline@Stir together flour, chopped rosemary, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center, then add water and oil and gradually stir into flour with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Knead dough gently on a work surface 4 or 5 times.@newline@Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll out 1 piece (keep remaining pieces covered with plastic wrap) on a sheet of parchment paper into a 10-inch round (shape can be rustic; dough should be thin).@newline@Lightly brush top with additional oil and scatter small clusters of rosemary leaves on top, pressing in slightly. Sprinkle with sea salt. Slide round (still on parchment) onto preheated baking sheet and bake until pale golden and browned in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer flatbread (discard parchment) to a rack to cool, then make 2 more rounds (1 at a time) on fresh parchment (do not oil or salt until just before baking). Break into pieces.	3
2192	Ceviche of Red Snapper	Other seafood may be used in this dish, including scallops, tuna, swordfish, squid, or monkfish. Fish with a relatively firm texture, like that of snapper, is the best choice. Select fish that is perfectly fresh, since the fish is "cooked" only by the acidity of the lime juice. Serve avocado slices as an accompaniment, and garnish the plates or platter with additional sliced tomatoes and sprigs of cilantro.	Cut the snapper into small dice or strips.@newline@Combine the lime juice, olive oil, jalapeo, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl and whisk to blend well. Add the snapper and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight.@newline@As close as possible to the time you wish to serve the ceviche, prepare the other vegetables. Peel and seed the tomatoes and cut into neat dice or julienne. Cut the red onion into very thin slices and separate the slices into rings. Cut the green onion, white and green parts, very thinly on the bias.@newline@Fold the cilantro into the ceviche and mound it on a chilled platter or individual plates. Scatter the tomato, red onion, and green onion on top of the ceviche.	12
2193	Squash Salad	Look for thin zucchini and yellow squash. The squash will have fewer seeds.	1. Cut the zucchini and squash in thin slices on the diagonal; place in a bowl.@newline@2. Prepare the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking constantly until thickened. Toss with the squash. Let rest 10 minutes.@newline@3. Place the arugula in a salad bowl. Cut the tomato in half lengthwise and then into very thin wedges; scatter over the greens.@newline@4. Before serving, spoon the squash and dressing over arugula. Sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, tossing at the table.	12
2194	Garlic Herb Bread	Garlic Herb Bread When buttering the bread, gently spread the slices without pulling them apart.	1. Combine the butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl.@newline@2. Shortly before serving, preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the bread into 1-inch slices without cutting all the way through. Spread the butter into each slice. Wrap the bread in aluminum foil, gathering it loosely over the top.@newline@3. Heat bread in the oven for about 20 minutes for the butter to melt. Serve in a basket, wrapped in a napkin.	7
2195	Baked Pears with Ice cream	Bartlett, Anjou, and Bosc are all great pears. Just be sure they are not overripe.	1. Preheat the oven to 375F.@newline@2. Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler. Cut them in half lengthwise, leaving the stems on two of the halves if possible, and remove cores with a small melon baller. Place in an 8x8-inch baking pan, cut-side down.@newline@3. Combine the lemon juice, apple juice, water, and brown sugar; pour over the pears. Set the pan over medium heat and bring the juices to a boil. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 40 minutes (basting after 15 minutes), or until the pears are tender when tested with a toothpick.@newline@4. Chill the pears overnight in the refrigerator, covered with the cooking syrup. Serve in four small dessert bowls to fit, cored-side up, with a small scoop of ice cream in the center of each. Spoon a little of the syrup into each bowl.	10
2196	Soft Tacos with Fried Parsley and Lemon	NoDescription	Heat 1 1/2 inches oil to 375F in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart saucepan, then fry parsley (use caution; oil will spatter) until leaves are dark green, about 45 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to several layers of paper towels and season with salt.@newline@Return oil to 375F, then fry lemon slices, stirring occasionally, until golden in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and season with salt. Serve parsley and lemon wrapped in tortillas.	12
2197	Tomato Sauce	Tomatoes, originally native to South America, were not introduced to Italy until the sixteenth century. Now, of course, it's almost impossible to think of Italian cuisine without dozens of delicious tomato-based dishes coming to mind.	Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saut until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and saut until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Add the basil and simmer for 5 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper.	8
2198	Cheese-Filled Risotto Croquettes with Tomato Sauce	Known as parancinip, or "little oranges," in Italian, these little balls, with their surprise melted cheese filling, are an excellent way to turn leftover risotto into a delectable hors d'oeuvre. They're so good, you might be inspired to make a batch of risotto just to enjoy in this form.	In a large bowl, combine the risotto with the Parmesan, cream, herbs, and egg yolk. Season with salt and pepper.@newline@Cut the cheese into 16 cubes. Scoop up about 3 Tbsp of the risotto mixture and pack it around a cube of cheese to make a croquette, a ball the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Repeat to form 16 croquettes.@newline@Put the flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs in 3 separate bowls. Dredge the croquettes in the flour, dip in the egg wash, and roll in the bread crumbs. Chill thoroughly, 2-24 hours.@newline@Pour oil into a tall pot to a depth of 5 inches. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375F on a deep-frying thermometer. Deep-fry the croquettes in batches, without crowding, until they are evenly browned, 4-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer to paper towels to drain briefly. Serve on a pool of warmed tomato sauce.	11
2199	Duck with Raspberries (Canard aux Framboises)	In this nod to chef Andr Soltner, who opened New York City's Lutce in 1961, we've streamlined his once modern take on duck  lorange. Duck breasts, roasted and then broiled until golden-crisp on top, end up perfectly medium-rare. To cut the meat's richness, we add a splash of raspberry vinegar and fresh berries to the pan sauce.	Put a large shallow flameproof roasting pan in middle of oven and preheat to 400F.@newline@Pat duck dry and trim off any excess fat. Score skin in a crosshatch pattern at 1/2-inch intervals with a sharp knife, then season with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper (total). Roast, skin side down, in hot pan until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 125F, 20 to 25 minutes.@newline@Turn on broiler. Turn duck skin side up. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer duck to a cutting board and let rest (skin side up) 10 minutes.@newline@While duck rests, pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan, then add shallots and garlic and sau over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and cook, stirring, until dissolved. Stir in vinegar, scraping up brown bits. Add demi-glace and bring to a simmer. Stir in half of raspberries.@newline@Force sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan, discarding solids. Skim off excess fat. Over low heat, swirl in butter. Remove from heat and add remaining raspberries.@newline@Slice duck and serve with sauce.	2
2200	Panna Cotta with Lemon-Thyme Peaches	Though we can appreciate the beauty of a panna cotta that's been turned out of its mold, the light-as-air texture of these, just set enough to melt in the mouth, will have you happy to eat them right from the cup. Yogurt gives the almond-infused cream a little tang, and peaches that have been macerated with lemon thyme just long enough to meld and soften seem to exist expressly for this dessert.	Make panna cotta: Sprinkle gelatin over water in a small heavy saucepan and let stand 1 minute to soften. Stir in cream and 1/8 tsp salt, then heat gently over medium-low heat, stirring, until gelatin has dissolved.@newline@Whisk together yogurt, honey, and almond extract, then whisk in cream mixture.@newline@Pour mixture into 4 small bowls and chill, covered, until set, at least 8 hours.	10
2201	Bibb Lettuce, Parsley, and Mint Salad	Generous handfuls of parsley and mint leaves are left whole, to hold their own alongside sweet ruffles of Bibb and thin slices of cucumber.	Whisk together lemon juice, oils, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss lettuce, herbs, and cucumber with just enough dressing to coat.	4
2202	Chicken-Fried Ribs	Like the classic steak preparation for which they are named, these crisp ppankop-crusted ribs cook fast, but they're surprisingly tender on the inside.	Make ribs: Preheat oven to 200F.@newline@Heat 3/4 inch oil to 325F in a deep 12-inch skillet over medium heat.@newline@Meanwhile, season ribs with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Put flour, eggs, and panko in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dredge ribs in flour, then coat with egg, letting excess drip off, and panko .@newline@Fry ribs in batches, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer first batch to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven. (Return oil to 325F between batches.)	11
2203	Mushroom Consomme with Morels and Pastry "Hats"	Paul Bocuse believes a great chef will invent only two dishes in his entire career; his own truffle soup with pastry "hats" will forever be known as his signature creation. Our version retains all the theater of the billowy dome of puff pastry and the richness of the flavors but substitutes mushroom consomm laced with morels and snips of fresh chives for the opulence of truffles and foie gras.	Make mushroom consomm: Simmer white mushrooms, onions, water, and 1 tsp salt in a 6-qt stockpot, uncovered, 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Strain mushroom mixture through a large sieve lined with a damp paper towel into a large saucepan, pressing gently on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Mushroom mixture should yield about 4 cups consomm. (If less, add water; if too much, boil consomm until it is reduced to 4 cups.) Discard solids. Season consomm with salt and pepper.	6
2204	Caramel Pecan Cakes	These individual cakes, from Lantern pastry chef Monica Segovia-Welsh, are moist, tender, and not remotely fussy. If you dont want to fool with the suggested accompaniments, serve the cakes with a dollop of whipped cream instead.	Make caramel: Bring sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals on side of skillet with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling skillet occasionally so caramel colors evenly, until dark amber. Remove from heat and carefully stir in remaining cup water (mixture will steam vigorously and may stiffen). Return to a boil and stir until caramel has completely dissolved. If necessary, simmer until just syrupy, 1 to 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature.	4
2205	Flatiron Steaks with Creamy Juniper Sauce with Hash Browns	When the gang is coming over for poker night, don't order pizza and substhis is what you should make. Flatiron steak is meaty, tender, and deeply satisfying. Crisped spuds soak up the meat's creamy, woodsy sauce, and we love the simplicity of making a single large hash brown that can be cut into multiple wedges.	Make hash browns Bring a 4-quart pot of salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 3 quarts water) to a boil. Meanwhile, peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Add potatoes to water and return to a boil, then boil 5 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl.@newline@Meanwhile, cook onion in butter with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 5 minutes. Add to potatoes and mash gently, leaving larger lumps.@newline@Add 2 tablespoons oil to skillet and heat over medium heat until it shimmers. Add potato mixture and pat out evenly.

2206	Wilted Greens with Warm Sherry Vingaigrette	Larry Forgione, a chef dedicated to preserving regional American cuisine and crops, inspired our wilted salad. In his cookbook pAn American Placep, collards are softened in a warm Sherry dressing. We found that the cream Sherry's sweet nuttiness also works especially well with baby fall greens like mizuna or beet tops. But choose the highest-quality leafy vegetables in season.	Mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook Sherry, vinegar, mustard, shallot, garlic paste, and sugar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking, until heated through. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.@newline@Toss greens with warm dressing. Serve immediately.	5

2216	Caviar Eggs	Laden with suitcases full of caviar, a thank-you gift from the Shah of Iran for cooking at his palace in 1978, Louis Outhier returned to France in need of a recipe that called for such extravagance. Oeufs au caviar was the result, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Outhier's young protg at the time, still serves the dish at his namesake New York City restaurant. Layered inside an eggshell, warm scrambled eggs and cold cream are accented with a regal dollop of caviar.	Open and sterilize eggshells: Carefully remove top third of each eggshell by tapping around egg with a paring knife, then gently pry off top and discard. Pour eggs into a bowl, reserving shells.@newline@Use a knife to tear any membrane remaining in bottom of eggshells. Generously cover shells with cold water in a 3-qt saucepan and add vinegar.

Strain into Martini glasses.	2
2218	Roasted Veal Chop with Morels	At La Cte Basque, this dish was originally served with an extremely rich cream sauce, but when Jean-Jacques Rachou took over in 1979, he reimagined a lighter version, one with pan juices and crme frache. It plays up the nutty, earthy morels beautifully.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle.@newline@Pour boiling water over morels in a small bowl and soak until morels are softened, about 30 minutes. Transfer morels with a slotted spoon to a medium-mesh sieve set over a bowl.

Simmer for 12 minutes, until the sweet potato is tender, stirring often and adding more milk if the mixture dries out.@newline@Transfer to a food processor or blender. Add the yogurt and lime juice; process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the warm bread.	5
2222	Volcano Surprise with Lemon Mousseline Cake	Baked Alaska is called an p"omelette norvgienne"p in French when made in the oval shape of an omelete. However, this dessert is done in a conical shape to emulate a volcano; hence its name. The top of a "volcano" is adorned with a hollowed-out lemon half that is filled (as soon as it comes out of the oven) with warm brandy, which is ignited, and the dessert is brought flaming to the table. The lemon mousseline cake, used here to hold the ice cream in the center, can be made a day or two ahead and stored in a plastic bag to keep it moist. If you prefer, a standard genoise or a sponge cake or pound cake can be substituted for the mousseline cake, as can ladyfingers.p	To make the lemon mousseline cake: Put the egg yolks, sugar, grated lemon rind, and vanilla in a bowl, and mix well with a whisk until smooth and thick. Add the potato starch and flour, and mix with a whisk.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until firm. Add about one-third of the egg whites to the egg-yolk mixture, and mix with a whisk to lighten the batter. Fold the remainder of the egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into a buttered 9-inch springform pan.@newline@Bake on a cookie sheet in the 350-degree oven for approximately 35 minutes. The cake should be nice and puffy as it comes out of the oven. Let cool in the pan in a warm place. The cake will shrink slightly but remain moist and spongy inside.	4
2223	Grilled East Coast Oysters with Corn Jalapeo Salsita	I've been a big fan of the plump and succulent wonders of oysters for a long timesince even before I started frequenting one of my favorite raw bars: the one in the Blue Ribbon, in Tribeca. Something about the charm of this particular example of our sea's bounty has always intrigued me. These days I prefer local (like Cape Cod) over other types of oysters, but, still, I'm open! The accompanying salsitawhich is tasty all by itself or even spread on a small salad of your favorite greensoffers a wonderful flavor and texture balance. I suggest making the accompanying sauce ahead of time so you can visit with your guests. Then just grill the oysters, plate them, and serve.	Light a fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Place the cornwithout anything on iton the grill grate. Grill the ears of corn, rotating the corn as needed to keep it from getting charred too much on one side, for about 7 minutes. (Don't overcook the corn, or it will become mushy!) Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Remove the kernels from the cobs and set aside.@newline@Meanwhile, squirt just a bit of canola oil on the tomato and onion slices. Sprinkle pepper on top. Place the onion slices on the grill. Add the tomatoes cut-side down on the hot grate and grill until both are nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the onion slices and tomatoes with tongs and continue grilling until the bottoms of the tomatoes (the rounded parts) are nicely browned and the onion becomes softer and fragrant, about 3 more minutes.@newline@Dice the onion and tomatoes and place in a bowl. Add the corn kernels and the jalapeo. Pour in the olive oil and vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt. This can be done up to one day ahead of time; just bring the salsita to room temperature prior to serving.@newline@Place the oysters directly on the grates of the grill, close the cover, and cook until all of the oysters have opened, 4 to 5 minutes. Discard any oysters that have not opened on their own. Further open the ones that have started to open and top each one with 1 teaspoon of the corn and jalapeo salsita. Serve hot.	10
2224	Yellow Tomatoes Stuffed with Grilled Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Cheese	This beautiful side dish is perfect not only because it looks gorgeous but also because it's totally consumable! This creation was inspired by a dish I had in Puerto Rico, where I enjoyed a typical pmofongop (mashed plantain dish) served in a ppilnpwhich is a kind of mortar. I thought then, "Wouldn't this be great in a tomato?" Since then, I've been dreaming up all kinds of tomato stuffers! My first choiceas far as mushroom fillersis domestic oyster, shiitake, or portobellos, which you can easily grill (or saut!) ahead of time. Also, Manchego is another delicious option for the cheese.	In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms with the olive oil, shallots, rosemary, and thyme; let sit for about 10 minutes.@newline@Light a fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Using tongs, remove the mushrooms from the marinade and grill until slightly softened and browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Set them aside. (You can also complete this step ahead of time, refrigerate the mushrooms, and then bring them to room temperature when you're ready to stuff the tomatoes.)@newline@Meanwhile, prepare the tomatoes so that you can use them to serve your salad in. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Using a sharp knife, slice the tops off the tomatoes either flat or in a zigzag pattern; you need them later so don't discard them. Using a melon baller or spoon, scoop out the insides. (You may want to save the insides for a sauce or another salad.) Set aside. Place the tomatoes into a 1-inch baking pan (you may have to adjust the bottomscutting carefully and only slightlyif they can't sit upright), with their tops. Bake until the skins start to wrinkle, about 15 minutes.@newline@When the tomatoes are finished, remove the tops and stuff with alternate layers of the mushroom mixture and the cheese. Place the tomatoes back into the oven (without the tops) just until the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes.@newline@Top each tomato with a bit of the mixed baby greens and a drizzle of the vinaigrette. Cover with the tomato tops, and serve.	10
2225	Frisee with Crisped Salmon Skin and Warm Sherry Vinaigrette	In case you shy away from the pork-fat dressing of the classic frisee, you can always turn to this lighter, but equally delicious version, which substitutes crackling salmon skin for the lardons. Broiled salmon skin is a sushi bar staple, and the ginger in this dish echoes that connection. And further interest is provided by a very sympathetic dose of sherry vinegar. A multi-culti triumph!	1. Make the croutons: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush both sides of bread slices with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cut into 1-inch cubes and bake croutons in oven on a baking sheet, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.@newline@2. Remove salmon skin from fillet and reserve fillet for another use. Lightly brush half tablespoon hazelnut oil on both sides of salmon skin and place on preheated grill until crispy, about 2 minutes per side. (Alternatively, you can crisp it under a broiler.) Pat salmon skin dry with paper towels, cut into three-quarter-inch dice, and set aside.@newline@3. Combine shallots, lemon juice, sherry vinegar, ginger, garlic, half cup of hazelnut oil, salt and pepper in a small saucepan and cook the dressing over moderate heat until shallots are wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes.@newline@4. In a large bowl toss the frisee, salmon skin, and croutons with warm sherry vinegar dressing. Divide among 6 plates and serve immediately.	6
2226	Espresso Cheesecake	NoDescription	Crust Preheat oven to 350F.@newline@Place the cookies in a small bowl, drizzle the butter over them, and stir, making sure the crumbs are evenly coated with butter.@newline@Place the cookie crumbs in an ungreased 9-inch spring-form pan. With your hands, pat and spread the crumbs evenly over the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 5 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool to room temperature.@newline@Lower the oven temperature to 200F.	4
2227	Dean & Deluca's Tuna Sandwich with Carrots, Red Onion, and Parsley	We sympathize with the purists when it comes to tuna salad sandwiches: the combo of canned tuna, just a little mayo, and just good white bread is an eternal verity. But we have developed this fancier variation that is also delicious. It preserves the tuna flavor, it's not too rich, it's loaded with crunchy vegetables, and it flies out of the store every day.	1. Put the tuna in a large bowl. Mash. Add the carrots, onion, parsley, celery, and scallions.@newline@2. Place the mayonnaise in a small bowl. Add the crushed garlic clove and the lemon juice. Add the mayonnaise mixture to the tuna. Mix together. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve on rolls with lettuce and tomato.	7
2228	Peppermint Cosmo	One cute cocktail contains only 7 grams of sugarincluding the candy cane. Sip and stay sleek!	Combine juices, vodka, peppermint and 1/2 cup water in a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously and strain into 8 shot glasses. Garnish with candy canes and mint.	9
2229	Duck Pizza with Hoisin and Scallions	Get your fix of two favorites (Chinese and pizza) in one crusty canapfor fewer than 150 calories.	Heat oven to 400F. Sprinkle duck with five-spice powder, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat. Cook duck until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer skillet to oven; bake duck until outside is cooked but inside is rare, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool 4 to 5 minutes. Thinly slice on the diagonal into 8 pieces, then cut each in half. Set aside. Form dough into 8 even balls, then flatten to form 3-inch disks and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Spread hoisin sauce on crusts with a pastry brush. Top with spinach, cheese, bell pepper and duck. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.	12
2230	Mac 'n' Cheese Minis	Savor these morsels with benefits: Each has nearly 20 percent of your calcium RDA.	Heat oven to 400F. Pour 1/2 the lemon juice into a mug or bowl and stir in cornstarch. Rub inside of a saucepan with garlic; cut clove halves into pieces and add to pan. Add broth, kirsch and nutmeg. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. Add cheeses. Reduce heat to medium, stirring until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. (Mixture will separate.) Stir in juice-cornstarch mixture, cooking until sauce comes together, 30 seconds. Stir in pasta and spoon into 8 small ramekins or espresso cups. Top with breadcrumbs; transfer to a baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, until tops bubble, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven; transfer ramekins to a wire rack to cool, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss arugula, remaining lemon juice and pepper in a bowl. Top each mac 'n' cheese with salad.	11
2231	Pumpkin Pie Cupcakes	Consider these "beauty" bites: They offer up 26 percent of your daily dose of vitamin A, which keeps skin and hair healthy.	Heat oven to 350F. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt until combined. Set aside. Mash granulated sugar and butter in another bowl until combined. Stir in egg white, then pumpkin, milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Add dry ingredients; stir until just combined. Pour batter into lined mini muffin cups to three quarters full. Bake until cupcakes spring back to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Beat cream cheese, margarine and confectioners' sugar in a bowl with a hand mixer until smooth. Add yogurt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla; beat until combined. When cupcakes cool, frost and garnish with zest.	8
2232	Cranberry Crunch Salad	Guests won't leaf these alone! A yogurt dressing and plenty of produce keep the tangy mouthfuls light.	Heat a small cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Toast pecans and celery seed, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Combine mayonnaise, yogurt, honey, juice and vinegar in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add pecans, celery seed, cabbage, apple and cranberries; toss well to coat. Place 2 tablespoons salad on each endive leaf.	4
2233	Quiche in Prosciutto Cups	Haute ham and eggs! These appetizers are protein-rich, and cutting out the crust makes them incredibly low-cal.	Heat oven to 400F. Coat a mini muffin pan with cooking spray. Press 1 piece prosciutto into each of 8 cups. Whisk egg whites and whole egg until smooth. Whisk in yogurt, olives, rosemary, salt and pepper. Divide mixture among cups. Bake, uncovered, until quiches are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Garnish with rosemary.	1
2234	Turkish Doughnuts with Rose Hip Syrup	Turkey is a paradise for street-food fans, and when Feniger travels there, she especially loves nibbling on the airy doughnuts soaked in syrup that are offered by many vendors. She made them her own by lacing a basic cream-puff dough with cardamom and cinnamon. Dried rose hips steeped in the syrup add a little texture and tartness to the sticky, fragrant bites.	Make rose hip syrup: Bring water, sugar, rose hips, and cardamom pods to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then gently simmer, uncovered, until rose hips are softened, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in rose water and lemon juice.	12
2235	Cantaloupe Aqua Fresca with Beet Swirl	Sold at Mexican street stands in large, clear barrelsthe better to show off their festive colorspagua frescasp, or "fresh waters," can be made with all kinds of fruits and herbs, the riper the better. Here, Feniger tops a traditional cantaloupe cooler with a decorative swirl of vivid beet pure. Roasting the beet heightens its sweetness and intensifies its color.	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Wrap beet in foil and put in a small 4-sided sheet pan, then roast until tender when pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes. Unwrap and let stand until cool enough to handle.@newline@While beet roasts, pure cantaloupe, 3 cups water, lime juice, and 1/4 to 1/3 cup sugar (to taste) in 3 to 4 batches in a blender until very smooth, about 1 minute per batch. Chill agua fresca until cold, about 2 hours.@newline@Peel and chop beet, then pure with remaining cup water and remaining tablespoon sugar in cleaned blender until smooth. Chill beet pure until cold, about 2 hours.@newline@To serve, pour agua fresca over ice in tall glasses, then dollop 1 Tbsp beet pure on top of each drink, swirling it decoratively with a spoon.	3
2236	Black Barbecue Pork Chops with Thumbelina Carrots	Based on depth rather than tanginess or sweetness, Lee's signature black barbecue sauce is a cultural interaction that includes the thin, Worcestershire saucelike "dip" for mutton ribs found in and around Owensboro, Kentucky; red-eye gravy; an earthy pmolep; and brothy, robust pkalbip, the braised short ribs of Korea. The melting pot, as they say, simmers on.	Make barbecue sauce: Heat butter and olive oil in a 4-to 5-quart pot over medium-low heat until foam subsides. Cook onion, chopped garlic, jalapeo, and raisins, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, 7 to 9 minutes.@newline@Add bourbon (use caution; alcohol may ignite) and boil, scraping up any brown bits, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in coffee, then boil until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with cola.@newline@Add ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, black bean paste, and chocolate and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.@newline@Add spices and 1 teaspoon pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 10 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and cool 15 minutes. Pure sauce in a blender with remaining 2 garlic cloves, lime juice, and sesame oil until smooth and thick.	7
2237	Lamb Shank Rag with Anson Mills Grits	Lee believes that classic dishes are far from being precious artifacts; they are inherently adaptable, and that's what makes them timeless. The starting point here was his "very Italian" wine importer, Enrico Battisti, but instead of polenta, Lee uses quick-cooking stone-ground grits from Anson Mills, in Columbia, South Carolina."They're better than any polenta," he says, "because they're so fresh. I call them hero grits."	Make rag: Pat lamb shanks dry and season with kosher salt (rounded 1/2 teaspoon) and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Brown shanks on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes, then transfer to paper towels to drain. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to pot, then cook onion, garlic, plum tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, and fennel with thyme, red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.@newline@Return lamb shanks to pot with stock, bourbon, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and honey and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.@newline@Remove meat from bones, discarding bones, and skim fat from cooking liquid, then return meat to pot. Simmer rag , uncovered, stirring frequently, 15 minutes.@newline@Just before serving, stir in radicchio and scallion.	4
2238	Country Ham and Cheddar Pretzel Bites with Jalapeo Mustard	Simultaneously salty, sharp, spicy, and sweet (in other words, completely irresistible), these nuggets are chef Edward Lee's way of saying, "You can have a casual meal without compromising true culinary endeavor." The tradition of serving mustard with a soft pretzel is strictly an American one; Lee makes his own honey mustard, jazzing it up with chiles. For sources for country ham and pretzel salt.	Stir together yeast, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and warm water in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, 5 to 8 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.) In a separate bowl, stir remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar into warm milk until dissolved.@newline@Add 2 1/2 cups flour and milk mixture to yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until a soft dough forms, adding up to 1/2 cup additional flour, a little at a time, if necessary. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled and bubbles appear on surface, about 2 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 400F with rack in upper and lower thirds. Line two 4-sided sheet pans with parchment paper.@newline@Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 4 equal pieces. Lightly dust your hands with flour, then gently roll and stretch 1 piece of dough to form a 12-inch-long rope. Flatten dough and arrange so a long side is nearest you, then roll out to a roughly 12- by 4-inch rectangle with a lightly floured rolling pin. Gently press one fourth of ham and cheese into lower third of rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch border along bottom edge. Stretch bottom edge of dough up over filling and press tightly to seal, then roll up as tightly as possible to form a rope. Cut rope into 12 pieces and transfer to a sheet pan. Make 3 more ropes with remaining dough, ham, and cheese and cut into pieces, transferring to sheet pans. Let rest at room temperature, uncovered, 30 minutes (dough will rise slightly).@newline@Bring water (6 cups) to a boil in a 4-to 5-quart saucepan. Reduce heat and stir in baking soda. Cook pretzel bites in batches in gently simmering water, turning once, until slightly puffed, about 20 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to sheet pans.@newline@Bake until puffed and golden-brown, about 15 minutes (cheese may ooze slightly).@newline@Meanwhile, stir together mustard, jalapeos, and honey.@newline@Brush warm pretzel bites with butter and sprinkle with pretzel salt. Serve warm or at room temperature with jalapeo mustard for dipping.	11
2239	Beet and Pear Napoleons with Ginger Juice Vinaigrette	What you find here and on page 96aside from a striking striped presentationis an equally beautiful expression of flavors. Because both beets and pears are at the height of their season, Lee has no desire, as he says, "to mess with them too much." He adds, "Nature trumps the ability of any chef." The ginger juice in the vinaigrette is inspired by Lee's Asian roots.	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Wrap beets in foil and roast until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand until cool enough to handle, then slice crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Cool completely.@newline@Meanwhile, finely grate ginger with a Microplane over a kitchen-towel-lined bowl. Carefully gather towel around ginger and squeeze until you have 2 tablespoons ginger juice. Whisk in orange juice, sugar, and oil. Season with salt and pepper. Divide vinaigrette evenly between 2 small bowls.@newline@Cut pears lengthwise around core into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut out 18 rounds from slices using cookie cutter and put in one bowl of vinaigrette.@newline@Cut out 18 rounds from beet slices and put in other bowl. Toss pears and beets with vinaigrette to coat well.@newline@To assemble napoleons, put 1 beet round on each of 6 plates (see cooks' note, below) and top with a tarragon leaf. Top with 1 pear round, then another tarragon leaf. Repeat layering 2 more times. Discard vinaigrette used for beets.@newline@Toss greens with some of remaining vinaigrette and place around each napoleon. Finely grate apple (including skin) into a bowl. Spoon a heaping teaspoon apple on top of each napoleon, then sprinkle with sea salt and poppy seeds. Drizzle with more vinaigrette if desired.	10
2240	Salted Mint Lassi	Yogurt drinks are popular throughout Indiasome are flavored with sugar or fruit, while others, like this one, are more savory. "I give sample tastes of this all the time at the restaurant," says Susan Feniger, "and people are shocked by how refreshing it is."	Toast cumin in a dry small heavy skillet over medium heat, shaking skillet frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer 1 1/2 teaspoons to a blender with mint, yogurt, kosher salt, and water.@newline@Blend until pale green with flecks of mint and cumin. Serve lassi over ice and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds.	3
2241	Barbecue-Rubbed Scallops with Creamy Sauerkraut Soup	Being the northernmost city in the South, Louisville has a complex blend of relatively unsung ethnicities, one of them being old-world German. The convergence of sauerkraut soupwhat families in neighborhoods like Schnitzelburg call home foodand barbecue-rubbed scallops is both quirky and logical in a very Louisville kind of way. The flavor combination is extraordinarily deliciousone taste and you'll understand what Edward Lee is all about. For sources for sumac.	Make soup: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 5-quart pot over medium heat, then cook bacon and onion, stirring occasionally, until most of bacon fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and wine and simmer briskly, uncovered, until most of wine has evaporated, about 3 minutes.@newline@Stir in stock and heavy cream, then simmer gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.@newline@Remove from heat and stir in mustard, sour cream, and remaining 2 tablespoon butter. Pure soup in batches in a blender until smooth and creamy (use caution when blending hot liquids), then return to pot. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.	8
2242	Slow-Cooked Tomato and Herb White Beans	These soupy beans resonate with the deep notes of tomato, garlic, and thyme. Meant to be served with the pcountry hashp , they would also go well with pork chops or grilled sausages.	Soak beans: Soak beans overnight (8 to 12 hours) in water to cover by 2 inches or quick-soak (see cooks' note, below), then drain.	4
2243	Tapioca Pilaf	Feniger first encountered this fragrant pilaf while visiting her friend Alan Wagner, who cooks at an ashram in India. The pilaf has since become a popular addition to Street's menu. The first thing you'll notice is the tapioca pearls gratifyingly chewy, almost slippery texture. Then you'll take in the pop of the mustard seeds, the denseness of the taro, the fresh coolness of the cilantro, and the savor of the peanuts and cumin. The most elusive flavor is that of the dried neem leaves. Theyre an optional ingredientyou can leave them out and the pilaf will still be deliciousbut they have an interesting astringency.	Bring water (10 cups) to a boil in a 3-to 4-quart pot. Add tapioca pearls and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until pearls are translucent around edge, have a white center, and are al dente, about 45 minutes more.@newline@While tapioca stands, cover taro with cold water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then simmer until almost tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer taro to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch dice.@newline@Drain tapioca in a sieve and rinse well under cold water. Let stand in sieve submerged in a bowl of cold water until ready to use.@newline@Heat butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then saut taro until just tender and golden, about 5 minutes. Add chile and garlic and saut until softened, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and neem leaves (if using) and saut until fragrant, about 30 seconds more.@newline@Lift sieve with tapioca out of water and shake to drain well. Add to taro mixture in skillet along with peanuts and 1/2 teaspoon salt and saut 2 minutes. Toss with cilantro and serve immediately.	5
2244	Tamarind Ginger Cooler	Both ginger plants and tamarind trees grow in tropical spots around the world, including India, Asia, and Latin America, where the two seasonings are regularly used in marinades, sauces, and drinks. So it was only natural for Feniger to take some of the spicy ginger syrup she had developed for the pCanton Ginger Kickp and mix it with tart tamarind. The result is very fresh and very quaffable. Feniger says that when they make it at Street, they often save the tamarind pulp that's left in the sieve and add more water; that tamarind liquid will be thinner than the first batch, but it will still have enough of its signature fruity sharpness for another round.	Break up tamarind with your fingers into a small heavy saucepan. Add 2 cups water and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up tamarind as it softens, 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes. Strain through sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids.@newline@Whisk together ginger syrup, tamarind pure, remaining 5 cups water, and kosher salt in a large pitcher. Chill until cold.@newline@Stir drink (it will separate as it stands), then pour into glasses filled two-thirds with ice. Top off with soda water.	6
2245	Braised Bacon Carolina Rice	It's pretty hard to upstage bacon, but if you get your hands on some heirloom Carolina Gold rice, the granddaddy of long-grain rices in the United States, that's what you might end up doing. Lee cooks it uncovered, which allows the water to evaporate and thus concentrates the richness of the chicken stock and tomato juice.	Cook bacon in a 4-quart heavy pot over low heat until some of fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in spices.@newline@Add stock and tomato juice and bring to a boil. Stir in rice and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes (rice will be moist rather than fluffy and dry). Stir in celery leaves, butter, kosher salt, and pepper to taste, then remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.	7
2246	Canton Ginger Kick	Kick is the right word to describe this golden cocktail, which underscores the shot of ginger liqueur with ginger syrup and lemon.	Stir together ginger syrup, vodka, ginger liqueur, and lemon juice in a pitcher.@newline@Divide among 6 (10-ounces) Old Fashioned glasses filled with ice. Top off with soda water. Spear a few slices candied ginger onto each of 6 wooden picks and add to drinks, then garnish with lemon wedges.	6
2247	Chess Pie with Blackened Pineapple Salsa and Caramel Sauce	The glory of a chess pie is its rich custard filling (long ago also used to fill tartlets called cheesecakes, hence the name). The secret to the accompanying salsa is to panfry the pineapple until it's charred, bringing out the fruit's acidic, musky qualities. And as for the last-minute drizzle of caramel saucehow bad could that be?	Make dough: Stir together flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl (or pulse in a food processor). Add butter and shortening and blend with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle 4 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.@newline@Squeeze a small handful: If dough doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated. (Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.)@newline@Turn out dough onto a work surface and form into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 1/2 hours.	11
2248	Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake	Chocolate and pears make an excellent combination. Here, bittersweet chocolate and sweet pears meld together to form the perfect balance. For this recipe, you can either take a rustic approach and toss the pears haphazardly into the pan or opt for a more elegant look by arranging the pears in concentric circles. Look for a good dark chocolate, which is not the same as unsweetened chocolate. Also, there are two kinds of unsweetened cocoa on the market; be sure to use unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa, not natural cocoa. When combined with baking soda, natural cocoa can impart a bitter taste to baked goods and cause them to rise too much.	Butter a 9-inch round baking pan.@newline@To make the fruit topping, put the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan (one with a tight-fitting lid) and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then cover and cook for 2 minutes. (Covering in this way allows the steam to wash down the sides of pan, which will prevent any sugar crystals from forming.) Uncover the saucepan and continue to boil the sugar, gently and slowly swirling the pan as needed to cook the caramel evenly, until it becomes a dark amber color. Occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Carefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan and allow it to harden. The pan will be very hot from the sugar, so take care in moving it if you need to. Fan the pear slices on top of the caramel in a circle around the perimeter, filling in the center with the remaining slices.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F.	9
2249	Confetti Corn BreadCrusted Shrimp in Creole Filling	I love the taste of buttery corn bread and the texture of the filling and the topping. This is a great dish to eat with soup spoons. For an attractive presentation, spoon generous portions into pretty rimmed soup bowls, or bake in individual casserole dishes or crocks. To save time, make the Creole Filling a day ahead (see Note).	To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saut pan or skillet over high heat. Add the onion, celery, and green bell peppers. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and Creole seasoning, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir constantly, about 2 minutes, until slightly thickened. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaf. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and heat through, about 2 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and pour the filling into an 8-by-8-inch square or round baking dish. Set aside in a warm area, while preparing the topping.@newline@To prepare the topping, preheat the oven to 375F. Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Incorporate the eggs one at a time and mix until smooth.

2250	Deep-Dish Winter Fruit Pie With Walnut Crumb	This deep-dish crumb-topped pie combines several winter fruits and confirms that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The pears become soft, the apples remain slightly firm, the figs add texture and sweetness, and the tart cranberries pop in your mouth, making this rustic pie a sensory treat. Be sure to plan ahead, as this recipe calls for chilling the dough for one hour, chilling it again after you roll it out (this reduces shrinkage of the crust during baking), and then baking the pie for over an hour. It is an hours-long process, off and on, but it is worth every minute. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a glass of apple or pear brandy (preferably from Clear Creek Distillery), it is the perfect final touch to a dinner party.	To make the pie pastry, put the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl, stir to combine, then put the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes.@newline@Add the butter to the flour mixture and toss to evenly coat. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender, a food processor, an electric mixer, or your hands, just until the mixture becomes coarse and crumbly and the butter is the size of peas. Stir the water and lemon juice together, then pour over the dry ingredients and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened.@newline@Dump the dough onto a well-floured work surface and press it into a 6-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.@newline@Roll the chilled dough into a 14-inch disk, then line a 9 or 10 by 3-inch springform pan with the rolled-out dough. Patch any holes and trim off any dough that hangs over the edges of the pan. Chill for an additional 30 minutes while you prepare the crumb topping and the fruit filling.	11
2251	Rhubarb Fool	The fool originated in England in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It is a simple dessert that combines tart fruit with whipped cream. The British traditionally made this dessert with gooseberries, but in spring rhubarb is the perfect choice, with its bright, tart flavor. A very simple dessert to prepare (we wince to say any fool can make it), this recipe calls for cooking a compote and then folding in whipped cream. It is elegant served with a shortbread cookie, which adds a delicious crispy element. To really doll it up, add a Candied Rhubarb Strip.	To make the fool, put the rhubarb, honey, orange zest and juice, candied ginger, vanilla bean, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to combine, then cover and cook, stirring every few minutes, for 10 minutes, until the mixture has come to a boil and the rhubarb has softened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then remove the vanilla bean. Transfer the compote to a bowl, and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, until very cold.@newline@Whip the cream and sugar until soft peaks form, either by hand or using an electric mixer on medium speed. Set aside 1/3 cup of the compote to garnish the dessert, then fold the remaining compote into the whipped cream. Spoon the fool into six 1/2-cup glasses or dishes and chill for 1 hour before serving topped with the remaining compote.@newline@Storage: This fool is best served the day it is made, but any leftovers can be covered with plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.	5

Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 20 minutes.@newline@Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then return to cleaned saucepan.@newline@Put 1/4 cup milk mixture in a small bowl and whisk in cornstarch. Return to saucepan, then boil over medium heat 2 minutes, whisking often (mixture will be thick). Remove from heat and add chocolate, stirring until melted and incorporated. Chill, stirring occasionally, until very cold, 3 to 6 hours.@newline@Freeze mixture in ice cream maker. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to firm up.	5
2282	Pierogi (Potato and Mushroom Sauerkraut)	Everyone's favorite Polish dumpling. Toothsome, warm, soft, and smothered in caramelized onionsyep, that's the stuff! In NYC, pierogi are a brunch staple. Our Polish diners are a disappearing breed, but you can live the life in your own kitchen.p	Make the Caramelized Onions Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet, preferably cast iron, over low heat. Add the oil and the onions and toss the onions to coat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, leaving a little gap for steam to escape. Stir occasionally, every 5 minutes or so. Onions should turn amber, but not burn, although a couple of darker spots are fine.@newline@Remove the cover and turn the heat up just a bit, to a medium setting. Stir often for 10 more minutes. Onions should become a darker amber, and some of the moisture should evaporate.	6
2283	Tempeh and Eggplant Pot Pies	Use any combination of vegetables for the filling here. The dough is perfect for making drop biscuits (a recipe found in pThe Joy of Vegan Bakingp) and the topping is perfect for fruit-based cobblers.	Preheat oven to 425F (220C, or gas mark 7). Coat 4 or 6 individual ramekins with oil, and set aside. You also can use a 9-inch (23 cm) square pan or a rectangular pan.@newline@To make filling, steam eggplant and tempeh for 10 to 15 minutes, until eggplant is soft and translucent. At the same time, add water or oil to a large-size saut pan and cook onion and celery until soft. Add fennel seeds, capers, and vinegar, and saut for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, red pepper flakes, and cooked tempeh and eggplant. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.@newline@Meanwhile, prepare biscuit dough. Place flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl, and stir together. Pour in nondairy milk and butter or oil, and mix just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. The dough should be lumpy and sticky, not smooth like cake batter.@newline@Remove saut pan from heat, and season filling with salt and pepper, to taste.@newline@Divide filling evenly among prepared ramekins. Drop dough by small spoonfuls on top of each ramekin. Carefully spread dough with back of spoon so it evenly covers filling. Bake pot pies until crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.	3
2284	Navy Bean Gravy	Most people seem to have a particular way they like their gravy. This one is of the thick, southern-style kinds that you serve on the side and is great for dipping your biscuit or potatoes in. Since everything is pureed, don't be too particular about how you chop the ingredients up. The thyme leaves don't have to be meticulously pulled from the stems; so long as the stems are tender enough to chop them up, toothat way everything comes together fast. An immersion blender comes in really handy here, but if you don't have one, a blender is just fine, too.	Preheat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saut the onion and garlic in the oil for about 5 minutes. Add the thyme and black pepper (I like a lot of black pepper in this) and cook for about 3 minutes more. While that is cooking, stir the flour into the broth until dissolved.@newline@If you have an immersion blender, then add the beans, broth mixture, and soy sauce to the saucepan. Blend immediately and lower the heat to medium. Stir the gravy often for about 10 minutes while it thickens.@newline@If you are using a regular blender, add the beans, broth mixture, and soy sauce to the blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the onion and the other stuff from the pan to the blender. Puree again until no big chunks of onion are left. Add back to the pot and stir often over medium heat to thicken.@newline@Once the gravy thickens, reduce the heat to low. Now you can decide exactly how thick you want it by adding splashes of water, anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Cook for about 20 more minutes to let the flavors deepen, stirring occasionally. Add water as necessary and taste for salt. Keep gravy covered and warm until ready to serve.	2
2285	Chocolate-Coconut Truffles	If you're making these sweets for your kids, remember that chocolate (raw chocolate in particular) can be somewhat stimulating. To avoid turning bedtime into party time, it's safer to make these a daytime snack.p	In a high-speed blender, blend the warmed coconut butter/oil, agave nectar, vanilla, and salt. Add the shredded coconut, 1/2 cup at a time, and blend until smooth.@newline@Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in 2 cups of the cocoa powder until thoroughly combined. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes or more to set slightly.@newline@Place the remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder onto a small plate. Spoon heaping tablespoons of the chocolate mixture and roll them into balls. Roll these in the cocoa powder. Store the finished truffles in the refrigerator.	11
2286	Beet Ravioli with Pine Nut "Goat Cheese" Rosemary-Cream Sauce, Aged Balsamic Vinegar	I made a beet ravioli dish for the restaurant menu when we first opened, and it remained popular for quite some time. Our regulars weren't at all happy when we finally took it off the menu. On special occasions, such as Valentine's Day, we've brought back variations on that beet ravioli, sometimes using cookie cutters for hearts or other sweet shapes. If you can find them, candy-striped beets are beautiful and unique, or try using golden beets, or even a combination of all three.	Pine Nut "Goat Cheese" Process all ingredients in a food processor until as smooth as possible.@newline@You should have about 4 cups. Reserve 2 cups for the sauce, and set aside the remainder.	6
2287	Lavender Chocolate Bars	This delicate, floral-scented chocolate showcases lavender. To harvest fresh lavender, select the freshest-looking flowers with the fullest color. Immerse all the blooms in water a few times to remove insects and soil. Then lay the flowers on towels and pat dry or gently spin dry in a salad spinner.	In the high-speed blender, combine the coconut oil, agave syrup, and lavender flowers. Process for 30 to 60 seconds, checking that the mixture is not getting too hot, until smooth. Add the cacao and almond butter and blend slowly on low speed until well mixed.@newline@Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the chopped almonds and raisins, and mix well.@newline@Spread the mixture onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper in a 12 to 1- inch layer. Top with the sliced almonds. Place in the freezer to chill until solid, about 15 minutes. Break into pieces and serve.@newline@Will keep for a month or more in the freezer.	6
2288	Blueberry Muffins with Lemon Blackberry Glaze	These muffins arelike blueberry biscuits served in a cupcake cup. They're moist, delicious, and look pretty with violet-colored glaze. Full of omega-3s and 6s, antioxidants, and vitamins, they're great in the morning with a cup of tea, juice, or smoothie.	To make the muffins, mix together the almond meal, flax meal, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the agave syrup, vanilla, and coconut oil and mix well. Add the water and mix to a batter consistency. Fold in the blueberries.@newline@Place 6 cupcake liners into a muffin pan and spoon about 1/2 cup dough into each. Place the pan in the dehydrator and dehydrate at 104F for 4 to 6 hours, until the batter is dry and to desired consistency.@newline@To make the glaze, combine the cashews, blackberry juice, lemon juice, agave syrup, and water in the Personal Blender with the 1-cup container and blend until smooth.@newline@To serve, frost each muffin with the glaze.@newline@Will keep for several days refrigerated. Can be frozen for several weeks and thawed. Warm muffins in the dehydrator at 104F for an hour or two before serving.	1
2289	Morning Sun	Brandi, our fearless juice bar manager, contributed to this recipe, and I love the name. It really does feel like sunshine in a glass and is a great way to start the day.	Run the oranges, apple, pear, pineapple, and ginger through the juicer.@newline@Pour a few tablespoons of the juice into a small bowl and whisk in the honey until completely smooth.@newline@Pour this mixture back into the juice, shake to combine, and pour over ice to serve. Garnish with the orange slices.	5
2290	Lemon Pudding Filled Coconut Cupcakes with Shaved Coconut Topping	My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-old's birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-olds birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste tests, was a huge hit with the kids, who are always our toughest fans. Packed with coconut for electrolytes, lemon juice for vitamin C, and bananas for potassium, these little gems keep us feeling great.	To make the pudding, place the cashews in the Personal Blender with the grinder lid and 2-cup container or a food processor and grind into a powder. Add the bananas, lemon juice, and agave syrup and process until smooth. Place in the fridge to chill.@newline@To make the cupcakes, combine the pecans, coconut, and salt in the food processor and process into evenly sized small pieces, taking care not to overprocess into a butter. Scoop the mixture into another bowl. Combine the dates and vanilla in the food processor and process into small pieces. Return the pecan mixture to the food processor and pulse to mix. The cake mix should have a crumbly but sticky texture.@newline@Place 6 cupcake liners in a muffin pan. Use a 1/2-cup measuring cup to scoop 1/2 cup loosely packed pecan mixture into each. Using your fingertips, gently press to firm up the cupcakes and create cavities in the centers to hold the pudding. Make sure the edges reach the tops of the cupcake liners.@newline@To assemble, scoop about 3 tablespoons pudding into each cupcake and top with coconut. Place the muffin pan in the refrigerator to chill for several hours to firm up the cupcakes before serving.@newline@The pudding will keep for a few days in fridge when stored separately. The cupcakes, stored separately, will keep for several weeks in the fridge. The assembled cupcakes will keep in the fridge for a few days.	8
2291	Beet Bundt Cake	*Soy-freep	Preheat oven to 375F (190C, or gas mark 5), and lightly oil a Bundt pan.@newline@In a mixing bowl, cream together oil and brown sugar. Add beets, melted chocolate chips, and vanilla, and mix well.@newline@In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt.

Cool completely. Before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar and top with blueberries, if desired.	6
2292	Corn on the Cob with Mint-Feta Butter	Food editor Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez, who created this menu, takes the Mexican tradition of sprinkling corn on the cob with pcotijap cheese and dried chile and turns it on its head. By substituting crumbled feta and mint, she gives the summer standby a Mediterranean slant. Cutting the ears into smaller sections makes them easier to coat with the buttery cheese and herb mixtureand way more fun to eat.	Stir together butter, feta, mint, and a rounded 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.@newline@Cook corn in a large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer with tongs to butter mixture and toss until well coated.	7
2293	Cumin-Scented Beef Kebabs	Tender, inexpensive sirloin flap steakanother name for the "tails" of porterhouses and T-bonesis ideal for kebabs. It's well marbled (the fat adds flavor on the grill), and its long, narrow shape makes it easy to cut into cubes. Robust and beefy on its own, flap steak tastes even better after being marinated in a paste of olive oil, cumin, coriander, and fresh oregano.	Stir together oil, oregano, garlic, spices, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl, then toss with beef. Marinate, chilled, at least 2 hours.@newline@Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (high heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure . Thread about 4 pieces of beef onto each skewer, leaving small spaces between pieces, then transfer to a tray.@newline@Oil grill rack, then grill beef, covered only if using a gas grill, turning, until browned but still pink inside, 4 to 5 minutes.	4
2294	Zucchini and Red Pepper Enchiladas with Two Salsas	Smoky grilled vegetablesnot a cloying amount of meat or cheeserule here. Instead of embellishing the enchiladas with a complex (and time-consuming) Mexican ppipinp (pumpkin-seed sauce), cook a few customary ppipinp ingredients and then pure them with cilantro for an easy enchilada that's herbaceous and fresh.	Start enchiladas: Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium heat; see Grilling Procedure .@newline@Preheat oven to 350F .@newline@Secure each onion round with a wooden pick for grilling. Oil grill rack, then grill vegetables, covered, turning occasionally, until tender (6 to 8 minutes for bell peppers and zucchini; 10 to 12 minutes for onion), transferring to a bowl.@newline@Wrap tortillas in stacks of 6 in foil and heat in oven, about 15 minutes.	8
2295	Pork Chops Saltimbocca with Sauted Spinach	Any excuse to cook a pork chop is a good excuse, and here is one of Italian origin: You get to stuff it with prosciutto, not to mention buttery Fontina and aromatic sage.	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.@newline@Cut a deep, wide pocket in each pork chop. Sprinkle half of sage into each pocket and stuff pockets with cheese and prosciutto. Pat chops dry and season with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total).@newline@Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch ovenproof heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook chops until undersides are golden, about 2 minutes, then turn chops and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until cooked through, about 5 minutes.@newline@While chops cook, heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 5-quart pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Saut garlic until pale golden, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.@newline@Transfer chops to a platter. Add butter and lemon juice to hot skillet, stirring and scraping up brown bits, then pour sauce over pork.@newline@Serve pork with spinach.	6
2296	Spicy Adobo Shrimp Cocktail	Shrimp cocktail quickly becomes much more than a classic first course when you give it some Latin flair. Try tossing lime juice, cilantro, piquant padobop sauce, and creamy avocado into the mix.	Cook shrimp in lightly salted boiling water until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes, then drain. Chill until cold, about 10 minutes.@newline@Gently stir together remaining ingredients with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then stir in shrimp.	7
2297	Tomato and Corn Pie	What's integral here is a very thin biscuit crust instead of one made of pastry dough. The inspiration is twofold: the tomato pie brought to us in August 1992 by the late novelist and food writer Laurie Colwin and James Beard's recipe for a quiche-like tomato cheese pie, which appeared in his American Cookery (1972). It's fun to imagine inviting the pair of them for lunch and serving this, along with a crunchy green salad and a big, beautiful glass pitcher of iced tea.	Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl, then blend in cold butter (3/4 stick) with your fingertips or a pastry blender until it resembles coarse meal. Add milk, stirring until mixture just forms a dough, then gather into a ball.@newline@Divide dough in half and roll out 1 piece between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into a 12-inch round (1/8 inch thick). Remove top sheet of plastic wrap, then lift dough using bottom sheet of plastic wrap and invert into pie plate, patting with your fingers to fit (trim any overhang). Discard plastic wrap.@newline@Preheat oven to 400F with rack in middle.@newline@Whisk together mayonnaise and lemon juice.@newline@Arrange half of tomatoes in crust, overlapping, and sprinkle with half of corn, 1 tablespoon basil, 1/2 tablespoon chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.@newline@Repeat layering with remaining tomatoes, corn, basil, chives, salt, and pepper, then sprinkle with 1 cup cheese.@newline@Pour lemon mayonnaise over filling and sprinkle with remaining cheese.@newline@Roll out remaining piece of dough into a 12-inch round in same manner, then fit over filling, folding overhang under edge of bottom crust and pinching edge to seal.@newline@Cut 4 steam vents in top crust and brush crust with melted butter (2 teaspoons).@newline@Bake pie until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes, then cool on a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.	3
2298	Lemon Ice Cream Sandwiches with Blueberry Swirl	Everyone's free to be a kid again with one of these wickedly good frozen treats in hand. Chewy blondie cookies bookend a thick layer of lemony ice cream (store-bought vanilla bumped up with lemon juice and zest) ribboned with a speedy blueberry compote.	Make lemon ice cream: Transfer ice cream to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 30 percent power in 10-second intervals, stirring, until softened, about 50 seconds total (see cooks' note, below).@newline@Stir in lemon zest and juice. Spread ice cream thinly in a 13-by 9-inch baking dish and freeze while making compote and sandwich layers.	9
2299	Radishes with Creamy Anchovy Butter	The French custom of serving radishes with sweet butter and sea salt is a lesson in simplicity; there's something so satisfying about a lick of creamy butter against the snap of peppery radish. Here, anchovy paste adds a singular savor to the butter, but the ease of the tradition remains. It's worth seeking out small radishes like the French Breakfast variety; if you can find only big ones, just halve them.	Blend butter in a food processor with anchovy paste, garlic, and lemon juice until smooth. Season with salt. Serve as a dip for radishes.	7
2300	Baked Tomatoes with Hazelnut Bread Crumbs	A topping of buttery whole-wheat bread crumbs and hazelnuts creates a toasty counterpoint to baked thick-sliced tomatoes. What prevents it from being too rich, though, is the accent of thymelemon thyme in particular. With its small green leaves edged in yellow, the herb is easy to spot at the farmers market. Still not sure? Take a sniff. Lemon thyme's brisk, citrusy scent is a real eye-opener.	Preheat oven to 350F with rack in middle. Butter a 2-quart shallow ceramic or glass baking dish.@newline@Spread bread crumbs in a 4-sided sheet pan and toast in oven until dried and pale golden, about 15 minutes. Cool crumbs. Increase oven temperature to 450F.@newline@Thickly slice tomatoes and arrange, overlapping, in baking dish. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon thyme. Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, then cook nuts and crumbs, stirring frequently, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon evenly over tomatoes.@newline@Bake until tomatoes are bubbling and crumbs are browned, 15 to 25 minutes. Cool to warm or room temperature and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon thyme.	4
2301	Farmers Market Salad with Aged Gouda and Roasted Portabellas	Lobes of golden mushrooms, shreds of buttery Gouda cheese, and the heartiness of spicy greens come together in this substantial salad. It's a terrific companion to the chive shortcakes, stew, and baked tomatoes, but keep it in mind when all you're after is a soup-and-salad supper.	Preheat oven to 425F with rack in middle.@newline@Toss mushrooms with 3 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a bowl. Roast in 1 layer in a 4-sided sheet pan, turning once, until golden-brown and tender, about 15 minutes. Cool mushrooms.@newline@Whisk together vinegar, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 5 tablespoons oil in a bowl until combined. Toss mushrooms, greens, and cheese with enough dressing to coat.	10
2302	Eggplant, Green Olive, and Provolone Pizza	Good, cheesy pizza generally doesn't need much help in the flavor department, but a grilled pie has a smoky dimension (here amplified by meaty grilled eggplant) that always leaves people clamoring for more.	Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium heat; see Grilling Procedure .@newline@Stir together garlic and oil. Brush some of garlic oil on both sides of eggplant and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Grill, covered, turning once, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes total. Cut into roughly 1-inch pieces.@newline@Stretch dough into about a 12- by 10-inch rectangle on a large baking sheet and lightly brush with garlic oil. Oil grill rack, then put dough, oiled side down, on grill. Brush top with more garlic oil. Grill, covered, until underside is golden-brown, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes.@newline@Using tongs, return crust, grilled side up, to baking sheet. Scatter eggplant, cheese, olives, and parsley over crust. Slide pizza from sheet onto grill and grill, covered, until underside is golden-brown and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.	9
2303	Garlic-Oregano Grilled Pita Bread	Pita rounds spring to life after just a couple of minutes on a hot grill: The dimpled surfaces of the flatbread crisp up in a nice contrast with their soft interiors (be sure to buy the pocketless kind of pita, which is fluffier than pita that is meant to be split and stuffed). A shake of crunchy kosher salt and a brush of garlicky olive oil flecked with oregano knocks them out of the park.	Heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook garlic, turning once, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Discard garlic and remove skillet from heat, then stir in oregano.@newline@Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure .@newline@Oil grill rack. Grill pitas, 3 at a time, covered only if using a gas grill, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes total per batch. Transfer to a cutting board and brush both sides with garlic-oregano oil. Cut pitas into wedges. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Serve warm.	9
2304	Greek-Style Salad	Radicchio adds streaks of scarlet and a pleasant bitterness to the usual Greek-salad suspects. A simple lemon and olive-oil dressing keeps things light and fresh.	Whisk together lemon juice, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until sugar and salt have dissolved.@newline@Add oil and whisk until combined well. Stir in tomatoes and onion and let stand 10 minutes.@newline@Add remaining ingredients and toss to coat.	7
2305	Plum Kuchen	This kuchen would be terrific made with all types of stone fruit, so feel free to substitute any of your summertime favorites for the plums.	Stir together yeast and warm water in mixer bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.)@newline@Add 2 cups flour, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, yogurt, egg, zest, and vanilla to yeast mixture and mix at medium-low speed 1 minute. Beat in 1 stick butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, until incorporated. Beat at medium speed until dough is smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes. (Dough will be very sticky.) Scrape down side of bowl and sprinkle dough with remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.@newline@Spread remaining 2 tablespoons butter in bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan and sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Cut each plum half into 5 or 6 slices and arrange in 1 layer pan.@newline@Stir dough until flour is incorporated, then spread evenly over plums. Loosely cover with buttered plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until almost doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Bake until kuchen is golden-brown and a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then invert and unmold onto a rack to cool completely.	12
2306	Butt in a Bag	This variation on the traditional method has never failed me. I learned it at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue event more than two decades ago from an Arkansas cook. It's simple. Place a partially smoked pork butt in a paper grocery bag and finish cooking by slow smoking it. The paper absorbs some of the grease and keeps the meat from drying out. People ask me, "Won't the bag catch on fire?" The bag will be saturated with pork fat, but a bag fire hasn't happened to me yet. For true Southern pork butt, go with hickory wood. However, I like to use fruitwoodmaybe even peach or cherrymixed with pecan. Because pork butt slow smokes for 6 hours, this is not a recipe to try on a gas grill.p	1. Mix the pepper and salt together and rub it on all surfaces of the pork. Set aside while you build the fire.@newline@2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. Oil the grill grate.@newline@3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals. Place the butt on the indirect side of the grill across from the coals. Increase the temperature to 350F by opening the bottom vents on your grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid. Place a candy thermometer in the lid vent. Smoke for 30 to 45 minutes to get the bark started.@newline@4. Reduce the temperature by closing the vents until you're at 225F to 250F. Smoke the pork for 4 hours. Place the butt in a brown paper grocery bag large enough to hold it, fold the ends over to close it, and return it to the same place in the smoker, opposite the fire. Add more briquets if necessary, and close the lid. Continue smoking for 2 to 4 more hours or until tender. Check for tenderness by pulling a piece of meat off and tasting it. The mark of a shoulder done to perfection is when you can remove the blade bone by pulling it out with your hand.@newline@5. When the shoulder is done, set it aside in a pan to rest for 30 minutes, then move it to a cutting board. Serve it Southern-style pulled (stringy portions torn off by hand), Kansas City-style thick sliced, or the-hell-with-it chopped. Some barbecuers like to mix in a little tangy barbecue sauce as they're chopping and combining the meat on a platter, especially if the pork is still a little fatty.	1
2307	Smoked Stuffed Chile Poppers	Chile "poppers"just pop 'em in your mouthare on many restaurant menus, and they're easy to prepare in your own backyard. They need to smoke at a higher temperature so the bacon wrapped around the outside of the chile gets cooked through. Although higher-heat smoking is technically not considered low-and-slow traditional barbecue, it does have its place in recipes like this one (and for people who use a ceramic smoker, which automatically smokes at a higher temperature). At a lower temperature, the bacon won't crisp up. You can also use this technique to smoke other bacon-wrapped appetizers like shrimp, water chestnuts, or green bean bundles. If you like, substitute goat cheese, garlic-and-herb cream cheese, or even pimiento cheese spread for the cream cheese and cheddar. You can also use almonds or walnuts instead of the pecans, or omit the nuts.p@newline@pThese poppers are so addictive that you can make a meal out of them! They are slightly fiery, but even friends who describe themselves as heat-intolerant have devoured these and raved about them. Jalapeos of any size will do, but the bigger ones hold more flavor and are easier to fill with cheese. I use a swivel-blade potato peeler or a paring knife to core the peppers. And remember to wear disposable food-handing gloves when touching fresh jalapeos, because oil from hot chiles will stick to your heands. If you rub your eyes or other sensitive areas after working with the chiles, it can be painful. If the chiles are mild, however, gloves aren't necessary.p@newline@pYou can buy metal chile popper racks, but you can also use cardboard egg carton. At 350F, the carton won't burn and you can simply throw it away when you're done. Another big plus to using an egg carton is that the carton absorbs bacon fat. This means no grease flare-ups. You can enhance the hickory or maple wood smoke flavor in the bacon by using that type of wood for your fire, or you can add a little different flavor to your poppers by using apple, oak, or pecan.p	1. To make the popper filling, combine the cheeses in a medium-size bowl and stir them together with a fork. Put the cheese mixture in a gallon-size zipper-top plastic bag and cut a small hole in one corner of the bag. Squeeze each jalapeo full of the cheese mixture. Place the cheese-filled jalapeos in the egg carton. Push a pecan half into each pepper. Wrap a half strip of bacon around each jalapeo and secure with a toothpick.@newline@2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to high.@newline@3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the drained wood chips on the hot coals, or put the dry wood chips in a metal container and place closest to a burner on a gas grill. Place the jalapeos on the indirect side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.@newline@4. Smoke the peppers at 350F for 1 hour and 15 minutes until the bacon is cooked and the jalapeo have a smoky aroma.	4
2308	Pimiento Cheeseburgers	Even folks in the South, where pimiento cheese is lovingly called the "pt of the South," will give you a quizzical look when you mention this burger. I always thought its true home was around Columbia, South Carolina, and the lower upstate area. But then I saw a pimiento cheeseburger on the menu in a wonderful burger joint and restaurant called Litton's, in Knoxville, Tennessee, so I guess a good idea can cross state lines. So here's how to do it, complete with a little pimiento cheese recipe, but the burger's not bad even if you have to use a good-quality store-bought pimiento cheese.	1. In a medium bowl, mix together the onion, both cheeses, mayonnaise, and pimientos. If you need additional mayonnaise to make it creamy, add a little bit at a time. Grind copious amounts of black pepper and stir that into the cheese mixture.@newline@2. Divide the ground beef into 6 equal portions and shape into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Remember to put a slight indentation into the center of each patty. Season both sides of the burgers liberally with salt and pepper.@newline@3. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes.@newline@4. Place the burgers on the grill and lower the heat to medium. Grill for about 5 minutes. Turn the patties and continue grilling until they reach your desired doneness, about 4 additional minutes for medium, 6 minutes for medium-well. During the last 2 minutes of cooking time, add the buns, cut side down. At the last minute before taking the hamburgers off the grill, put a generous spoonful of pimiento cheese on each.

2318	Whole-Wheat Pasta with Pecorino and Pepper	We often take black pepper for granted, grinding it onto every dish in sight.

2320	Clay-Pot Miso Chicken	Though this rich, intense, homey stew has the depth of a recipe handed down through generations, it's actually a modern interpretation, by Momofuku partner Joaquin Baca, of a Mexican stew he grew up eating, made with Japanese ingredients.

Pour the olive oil into the big pan, and set over medium-high heat. Lay the roast in, and brown it on each side for a minute or two, without moving, until caramelized all over.

Drop in the rosemary, sage leaves, grated nutmeg, peppercorns, dried porcini, and remaining teaspoon salt, and toss all together. Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping up the browned meat bits on the pan bottom, just until the vegetables soften, then lower the heat.@newline@Push the vegetables to the sides, and return the roast to the pan, laying flat on the bottom. Pour in the three bottles of wine and any meat juices that collected on the platter. The roast should be at least half submergedadd beef stock as needed.@newline@Cover the pot, and heat until the wine is steaming but not boiling. Uncover the pan, and place it in the oven. After 30 minutes, rotate the roast so the exposed meat is submerged in the braising liquid. Braise this way, turning the meat in the pan every 30 minutes, for about 3 hours, until fork-tender.

When its internal temperature reaches 180Fit should be easily pierced with a forktake the pan from the oven. Remove the meat to a platter, with intact carrot and celery pieces to serve as a garnish.@newline@Skim any fat from the braising juices, heat to a boil, and reduce to a saucy consistency that coats the back of a spoon. Pour through a sieve set over a clean container. Press in the juices from the strained herbs and vegetable pieces. Pour in any juices from the meat platter, and season the sauce to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (If you are not going to serve right away, put the meat and reserved vegetables in the sauce to rest and cool, for a couple of hours or overnight.)@newline@To serve, slice the meat crosswise (easier when it is cool). Pour a shallow layer of sauce in a wide skillet, and lay the slices in, overlapping. Heat the sauce to bubbling, spooning it over the beef, so the slices are lightly coated. Lift them with a broad spatula, and slide onto a warm platter, fanned out. Heat the carrots and celery in the sauce too, if you've saved them, and arrange on the platter. Serve, passing more heated sauce at the table.	5

2370	Easter Lamb Soup	MAGIRITSAp@newline@pEditor's note:p This recipe is excerpted from Aglaia Kremezi's book pThe Foods of Greecep.p@newline@pTo read more about Kremezi and Greek Easter, pclick here.p@newline@pMagiritsap is made with the parts of the lamb not used for the spit-roasted Easter lamb, which is usually very small (about 20 pounds). In the classic recipe, all the innards  heart, lungs, and so forth  go into the pot, but they do not really contribute to the taste. The flavor of the stock comes from the boiled head and neck, and the soup gets its distinctive taste from scallions, fresh dill, and the egg-and-lemon mixture.p@newline@pThere are lots of different pmagiritsap recipes. A friend described to me the one her family prepared in Halki, a small island that is part of the Dodecanese. In her family's version, no innards were used because, in Halki as in all the Dodecanese, they do not roast the lamb on the spit but instead stuff it with rice and the innards. So in Halki's pmagiritsap, many lambs' heads were boiled to make a very tasty stock, to which egg and lemon sauce is added at the end. The heads were not boned, but as they cooked for many hours, even their bones became soft. Each member of the family got one head and ate it with the broth. No scallions or dill were added to the pmagiritsa.p	Wash the lamb head and neck thoroughly and place in a pot with the onions. Cover with cold water, season with salt, and simmer for about 1 hour, skimming the surface several times.@newline@Cut the intestines into several pieces and wash thoroughly under running water. If you like, slice them open so you can wash them more easily. In a separate pan, bring some salted water to a boil and add the intestines. Blanch for 2 minutes, then remove with a skimmer and discard the water. Chop the intestines finely. You don't need more than 1 cup of chopped intestines.@newline@The head and neck are done when the meat falls from the bones. Remove them from the pot. Using a sharp knife, cut open the head and separate the meat from the bones. Remove the meat from the neck and cut all the meat into small pieces. Strain the stock and discard the onions. Let the stock cool and remove the fat. (Up to this point, the preparations can be made a day ahead. You can refrigerate the meat and the stock, making it easier to skim off the fat.)@newline@To finish the soup, wash the liver well and cut it into small cubes. In a skillet, heat the olive oil and saut the liver with the scallions and chili pepper, if using. Add the finely chopped meat and intestines, together with 1 cup of the dill, and turn a few times with a wooden spoon. Transfer the mixture to a pot and add the stock plus an equal amount of water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. Taste and add more pepper and salt if needed.@newline@Beat the eggs in a large bowl with about 2 spoonfuls of water and the juice of 1 lemon. Slowly add cupfuls of the hot soup to the bowl, beating continuously with the whisk. When the egg mixture is very hot, pour it slowly into the pot, stirring well, over very low heat, to prevent curdling. Taste and add more lemon juice if needed. Sprinkle with the rest of the dill, and serve immediately.@newline@NOTE: Some people add 1/2 to 1 cup short-grain rice to the soup.@newline@If you hate the taste of boiled lamb, you can make an equally tasty magiritsa with chicken livers and chicken stock. There is even a meatless magiritsa. Saut the scallions and dill, adding a few chopped leaves of romaine lettuce. Pour in water or stock and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Make the egg and lemon mixture as described above and serve.	7

2376	Zucchini-Blossom Quesadillas	Though many of us associate quesadillas with flour tortillas, in Mexico they're often made with uncooked corn tortillas that are folded in half around a filling like a turnover, then cooked on a griddle or fried. Here, we've enclosed delicate zucchini blossoms, tomatoes, onions, and Oaxacan string cheese.	Cook onion, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Add tomato and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato breaks down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add blossoms and 1/4 teaspoon salt, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.@newline@Combine tortilla flour, water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and knead until a uniform dough forms, about 1 minute.@newline@Pinch off enough dough to form a 1 1/2-inch ball and transfer to a plate; dough should be moist but not sticky. If necessary, knead in a little more tortilla flour or water. Form remaining dough into about 13 (1 1/2-inch) balls, transferring to plate, and cover with plastic wrap.@newline@Press 1 ball of dough between plastic squares in tortilla press to form a 5 1/2- to 6-inch tortilla (less than 1D16 inch thick). Peel off 1 plastic square, then, holding tortilla in your palm, put 1 rounded tablespoon cheese (1/2 ounce) on one side of tortilla and spread 1 rounded tablespoon filling in a flat layer over cheese, leaving a 3/4-inch border. Fold tortilla in half, using plastic square as an aid, and pinch edges to seal, flattening slightly.@newline@Make more quesadillas in same manner, arranging them in 1 layer and covering with plastic wrap.@newline@Very lightly oil comal (or pizza pan), then heat over medium-high heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Cook quesadillas, 3 at a time, until edges loosen from comal and brown spots appear on underside, 2 to 4 minutes, then turn over and cook, gently pressing quesadillas flat with a metal spatula if necessary, until brown spots appear on underside, 2 to 4 minutes more. Serve immediately with salsa on the side.	12
2377	Colombian Arepas	These tasty cornmeal cakes can be found grilled, baked, or fried in several Latin American countries.

2382	Ecuadoran Potato Cakes with Peanut Sauce	Wait until you try these llapingachos. The name may be hard to pronounce ("yop- in-GAH-chos," if you were wondering), but these mashed-potato patties from the mountains of Ecuador have a crisp exterior and a warm, cheese-laced pillowy middle that might be better served by a word that's much easier to say: perfecto.	Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Cover potatoes with cold water in a medium pot, then stir in 1 teaspoon salt and simmer until very tender, about 18 minutes.@newline@While potatoes simmer, cook garlic and 1/3 cup scallions in 2 tablespoons annatto oil in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes.

2388	Grilled Tamales with Poblanos and Fresh Corn	Tamalesmeat or vegetable fillings surrounded by masa dough and steamed in softened corn-husk packetsare a Latin American staple, and this rendition cleverly showcases corn in three distinct forms. Kernels of fresh sweet corn brighten up a dough made from corn tortilla flour. (Adding cornmeal to store-bought masa flour helps mimic the texture of fresh tamale dough, a trick we picked up from Magda Bogin at the Cocinar Mexicano cooking school in the town of Tepoztln.) Poblano chiles add a touch of heat, but it's the time on the grill that gives the tamales real fire. The husks develop a light char, and the smoky flavor penetrates the tamale, accenting the corn in all its dimensions beautifully.	Cover husks with hot water in an 8-quart pot or large bowl and soak, keeping submerged with an inverted plate, until softened, about 30 minutes. Rinse husks, 1 at a time, under running water, then pile on a plate. Cover husks with a dampened clean kitchen towel.@newline@While husks soak, roast chiles on their sides on racks of gas burners on medium-high (or on rack of a broiler pan about 2 inches from broiler), turning with tongs, until skins are blackened all over, 4 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, then cover and let stand 10 minutes.@newline@Peel chiles, then stem, seed, devein, and coarsely chop.@newline@Whisk together tortilla flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and 1 3/4 teaspoons salt. Stir in water and let stand 5 minutes. Add 1 cup lard and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until absorbed. Let dough stand until ready to use (dough will stiffen).@newline@Cook onion with 1/2 teaspoon salt in remaining tablespoon lard in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add chiles and corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, then stir into masa dough.@newline@Put 1 husk on a work surface, pointed end away from you, and, spreading it flat, mound 1/4 cup filling in center, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides. Bring wide end of husk over filling to cover, then fold in sides. Fold pointed end of husk over to form a packet and arrange, folded side down, on surface. Form more tamales in same manner.@newline@Arrange tamales in 2 steamer racks and/or pasta pot inserts, standing them up in 1 layer in rows so they resemble fallen dominoes. Set steamer racks (on top of each other) over boiling water in a pasta pot (use 2 pots if you can't layer your racks; water should not touch racks) and steam, covered tightly, until filling is firm, about 1 hour. (Replenish water as necessary.)@newline@To check for doneness, open 1 tamale to see if filling is firm and separates easily from husk; if it doesn't, steam 5 to 10 minutes more.@newline@Remove steamer racks from heat and let tamales stand 10 to 20 minutes while preparing grill.@newline@If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When coals are lit, dump them out across bottom rack (do not bank coals). When charcoal turns grayish white (start checking after 15 minutes), grill will be at its hottest. The grill will be at the right heat when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack over coals for 1 to 2 seconds.@newline@If using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes.@newline@Oil grill rack, then grill tamales, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until grill marks appear on corn husks, 4 to 6 minutes total.	1

2442	Spiced Orange Wine	What could be more French countryside than pulling a chilled bottle of homemade (or at least home-doctored) wine from the fridge for a special celebration? This orange sipping wine is a little sweeter and stronger than a regular glass of white, and it's the perfect aperitif for the ponion tart with mustard and fennelp .	Bring all ingredients except oranges to a boil (reserve wine bottles and corks), stirring until sugar has dissolved.@newline@Remove zest from oranges in a continuous spiral using a vegetable peeler and cut off any white pith with a paring knife. Reserve oranges for another use and divide zest between empty wine bottles.@newline@Fill bottles with orange wine and cool, uncorked, 1 hour.@newline@Cork bottles, then chill at least 4 hours.	10
2443	Onion Tart with Mustard and Fennel	Simple savory tarts abound in Provence. A particular favorite includes slow-cooked onions, mellow and nearly as sweet as marmalade, punctuated with hints of the herbs that grow wild all over the regionin this case, fennel. Cooks are known to vary their crusts depending on the affair, from short, buttery versions to pizzalike yeast crusts; the latter is used here to keep the tart light.	Stir together yeast and warm water in a small bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.)@newline@Put 1 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl, then make a well in center of flour and add yeast mixture to well. Stir together egg, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt with a fork. Add egg mixture to yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon or your fingertips, gradually incorporating flour, until a soft dough forms. Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead, working in additional flour (up to 1/4 cup) as necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.@newline@While dough rises, heat remaining 1/3 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then saut fennel seeds until a shade darker, about 30 seconds. Stir in onions, remaining teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then reduce heat to medium-low and cover onions directly with a round of parchment paper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very tender and golden brown, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F with rack in middle.@newline@Knead dough gently on a floured surface with floured hands to deflate. Pat out dough on a large heavy baking sheet (preferably blue steel) into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle, turning up or crimping edge, then brush mustard evenly over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edge. Spread onions evenly over mustard, then sprinkle evenly with cheese.@newline@Bake tart until crust is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cut into 2-inch squares or diamonds and serve warm or at room temperature.	2
2444	Jasmin's Pad Thai	Jasmin is a piece of work. Her single-word name only enhances her celebrity status. She's the chef/proprietor of her eponymous quintessential beach hut restaurant on the northern tip of Koh Phi Phi in Thailand. A tall, sexy native with long jet black hair and flowing silk dresses, she's as sharp as a razor blade and intimidating as hell. If you ask her a question, she stops, squints her eyes dubiously, and raises an eyebrow. She's the Queen Bee here. Her worker bees are the little barefoot gypsy kids who live on the beach, the happiest kids I've ever seen. They take her orders, serve her food, and assist her in effortlessly knocking out the freshest and most delicious Thai dishes aroundher clientele buzzes in from every surrounding island. "Just bring us whatever you'd like" (I try to skip the questions). I'll kick back with a Singha and watch those iconic longtail boats pull up with ice crates of screamingly fresh local fish, and I'm eating perfectly executed delicacies fifteen minutes later. Here's a woman who is truly about abundance, joie de vivre, and a spirit so vibrant that it inspires everyone. A true domestic goddess. She graciously taught me this classic in her (outdoor) kitchen on the beach.	Get your mise completely ready to go, because this dish only takes about 5 minutes to cook.@newline@In a wok (of course you can use a frying pan, but it's just not the same; even those cheap stainless steel ones work better than a pan), fry the red onion in a little peanut or olive oil. Add the shrimp (or calamari, chicken, or pork). Cook for a minute. They'll continue so don't worry too much if they're still slightly opaque, and move them over to the side. Make a well in the center. Crack the egg in there and scramble with a fork till cooked. Push over to the side along with the shrimp.@newline@Break the noodles in half (unless your wok is the huge industrial size), and add to the center with about 1/4 cup of the stock, the  sh sauce, tamarind sauce, palm sugar (dissolve it in a little hot water if too thick), and red chile akes. Mix well into the noodles, leaving the shrimp and scrambled egg off to the side.@newline@Cook the noodles in the sauce for a few minutes, stirring lightly to ensure that they don't clump together. The noodles should be just softenedyou want them nice and chewy. Taste and adjust the seasoningand add more stock if necessary.@newline@Now add the bean sprouts and the scallions, stir everything together, and heat it through. Immediately turn onto large plate and top with the chopped cashews. Garnish with lime and cucumber slices.@newline@You now just need a pair of chopsticks and an ice cold Singha.	10

2454	Mini Rack of Lamb with Nutty Beluga Lentils and Sauted Garlic Spinach	The three main elements in this recipe make an unbeatable combination. The soft, sweet taste of the lamb coupled with full green flavor of the spinach and the nutty, full-bodied taste of the lentils makes every bite a gastronomic pleasure. These lentils are one of my favorites. I've interpreted a recipe from the masterful chef Judy Rodgers of San Francisco's Zuni Caf.	Preheat the oven to 375 F.@newline@In a medium saut pan place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and heat for a minute over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery, and saut the vegetables until they are softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the lentils and bay leaf and saut for 3 minutes, coating all the lentils. Increase the heat and add the red wine. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring, until the mixture becomes dry. Meanwhile, in a saucepan bring the chicken stock to a simmer, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm. Add the warm chicken stock to the lentils (like cooking risotto) 1/2 a cup at a time, letting the lentils absorb the liquid with each addition. Repeat, stirring the mixture constantly. After 28 to 30 minutes the lentils should be slightly chewy and tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.@newline@While the lentils are cooking, rinse and pat the lamb dry and rub it with a tablespoon of olive oil. Season the meat with salt and pepper, then press the rosemary into the flesh.@newline@Place the lamb in a small roasting pan in the middle of the oven, and roast for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat registers 140 F.@newline@While both the lentils and the meat are cooking, prepare the spinach. In a medium saut pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil for a minute over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut until just translucent but not brown. Add the spinach and saut for 2 minutes, then cover and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until completely wilted. Season with salt and pepper.@newline@Slice the rack in half. On two large dinner plates, arrange a bed of lentils and a side of spinach, then place the lamb on top of the lentils and serve.	7
2455	Onion Soup with Loads of Thyme and Giant Gruyre Crostini	Whenever the weather begins to get cold, I begin to fantasize about that perfect bowl of French onion soup. The top is golden and crisp, the cheese has blistered and fallen and is completely melted, and gooey bits are stuck to the outer sides of the bowl. When I cut through the cheese, the bread is slightly crisp, but mushy at the same time. I fill my spoon with the rich, full broth crammed with soft, sweet, smoky onions. Here's my fantasy in a bowl.	In a heavy 5-quart pot melt the butter over low heat. Add the onions, thyme, bay leaf, and salt and pepper to taste and cook until the onions are deep amber and exceedingly soft, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the wine, increase the heat, and let the wine bubble away for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beef stock and water, and let the soup simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.@newline@Preheat the oven to broil. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven.@newline@Place the ciabatta on the middle rack of the oven and toast until crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.@newline@Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs from the soup and discard. Pour the soup into two ovenproof bowls, float the toasted ciabatta on top, and cover it with a thick layer of the Gruyre. Put the soup bowls under the broiler on the middle rack and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and golden.	4
2456	Braised Brisket with Thirty-Six Cloves of Garlic	In my take on the French classic, chicken with forty cloves of garlic becomes brisket with thirty-six cloves. All that feisty garlic turns sweet and mellow with gentle braising; when pureed, it forms a seductive gravy, which is finished with a zing of chopped raw garlic and lemon zest.p	Preheat the oven to 325F.@newline@Drop the garlic cloves into a small saucepan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain immediately. Peel as soon as the garlic is cool enough to handle. Set aside on paper towels to dry.@newline@Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed roasting pan or casserole large enough to accommodate the meat in one layer. Use two burners, if necessary. Add the brisket and brown well on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a platter and set aside. (Or brown the meat under the broiler: place the brisket, fat side up, on a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler. Broil for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, until browned. Don't allow it to develop a hard, dark crust, which might make the meat tough or bitter. Move the meat around as necessary, so it sears evenly.)@newline@Pour off all but about 1 tablespoon of fat remaining in the pan and add the garlic cloves. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic edges are tinged with gold. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add the stock, thyme, and rosemary sprigs, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Salt and pepper the brisket to taste on all sides, and add it to the pan, fat side up. Spoon the garlic cloves over the meat.@newline@Place the brisket in the oven, cover (if you have no lid, use heavy-duty foil), and cook, basting every half-hour, until the meat is fork tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours or longer. (As the meat cooks, periodically check that the liquid is bubbling gently. If it is boiling rapidly, turn the oven down to 300F.)@newline@The brisket tastes best if it is allowed to rest, reabsorbing the juices lost during braising, and it's easiest to defat the gravy if you prepare the meat ahead and refrigerate it until the fat solidifies. That is the method I use, given here, but the gravy can be prepared by skimming the fat in the traditional way, if you prefer. If you go that route though, do let the meat rest in the pan sauce for at least an hour.@newline@Cool the brisket in the pan sauce, cover well with foil, and refrigerate until the fat congeals. Scrape off all solid fat. Remove the brisket from the pan and slice thinly across the grain.	12
2457	Roasted Orange Molasses Sweet Potatoes	No southern holiday meal would be complete without sweet potatoes, and this simple twist on old-fashioned candied yams, with the addition of molasses and an orange's juice and zest, tastes bright and full of nuance.	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450F. Generously butter a large (13- by 9- by 2-inch) shallow baking pan.@newline@Heat zest, juice, molasses, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until molasses is dissolved.@newline@Toss potatoes with molasses mixture in baking pan and arrange, cut sides down, in 1 layer. Bake, uncovered, turning over once (to other cut side), until tender and glazed, 25 to 30 minutes.	1
2458	Hungarian Chocolate-Walnut Torte	This is a taste of prewar Hungary, from the family repertoire of my dear friend, Judy Abrams, gifted teacher and poet. Based on ground walnuts and leavened only with eggs, this light, fudge-luscious cake has not a jot of butter or flour, making it Passover-perfect for meat or dairy meals.p@newline@pTo conclude a meat meal, it is delectable plain or dusted fancifully with confectioners' sugar (a Passover recipe without cornstarch below) or glazed with a simple chocolate icing.p@newline@pFor a dairy dish, cover the torte in swirls of lightly sweetened whipped cream or serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side, accompanied by a steaming cup of strong cappuccino.p@newline@pEnjoy this beautifully moist and virtually no-fail torte not just on Passover, but year round. When well wrapped (without icing), it keeps very well, tasting even better a day or two after it is made.p	Have all ingredients at room temperature.@newline@Line the bottom of an 8-inch square cake pan or a 9-inch springform pan with parchment or wax paper.@newline@Preheat the oven to 350F.@newline@In a heavy-bottomed 2-or 3-quart saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly over medium heat. Continue boiling and stirring until all the grains of sugar have completely dissolved and the mixture forms a simple syrup. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chocolate until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool.@newline@In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer until light and thickened, about 4 minutes. Grind the walnuts with the remaining sugar and the matzoh meal in a food processor using the pulse motion and stir into the egg yolks. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and combine thoroughly.@newline@Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites in another bowl until they hold stiff peaks. Gradually fold the whites into the chocolate-walnut mixture, incorporating them gently but thoroughly so that no whites are visible. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until puffed and almost set but still a little gooey in the center. A wooden toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge should come out clean.@newline@Remove the pan from the oven and let cool on a rack. When completely cool, unmold the cake by running a thin-bladed knife around the edges of the cake to release it from the pan (or release the springform); invert onto a platter. Peel off the parchment paper. Serve the torte at room temperature.@newline@If desired, lightly dust with Passover confectioners' sugar. For a lovely, simple presentation, place a doily or a stencilhandmade by you or, even better, your childrenover the torte, then sprinkle with the sugar. Carefully remove the doily or stencil.@newline@Or glaze with the chocolate icing. Lay long strips of wax paper or foil on a cake plate or serving platter and place the cake on top. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Using a spatula, evenly spread the glaze over the top and sides. Now, pull out and discard the paper strips or foil strips--the plate will be clean and ready for serving. If you'd like, garnish with a few walnut halves attractively placed in the center of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for about an hour to set the glaze, but bring it to room temperature before serving.@newline@The plain or frosted torte is heavenly with generous dollops of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.	9

Remove the loin from the brine and lightly pat dry with paper towels.@newline@Sprinkle the rub evenly on all sides.@newline@Using your hands or a brush, evenly, but lightly, coat the loin with canola oil.@newline@Insert a remove thermometer into the center of the meat.@newline@5. Place the loin in the cooker and cook until the internal temperature reaches 135F, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.@newline@6. Give the glaze a quick shake to reincorporate any ingredients that may have settled. Brush the loin with the glaze and return to the cooker until the internal temperature reaches 145F, about 15 minutes. At this point the meat will be slightly pink in the center; cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes for more well-done.@newline@7. Pour about half of the remaining glaze on a cutting board and top with the loin. Let rest for 10 minutes.@newline@8. Slice the meat into 1/4-inch slices. Dredge the slices in the glaze, adding additional as needed to coat the exposed sides. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and pepper.	8
2503	Pecan-Crusted Pork Tenderloin Pinwheels with Carolina Mustard Sauce	Cooking Method: Direct Heatp@newline@pSuggested Wood: Hickory, Pecanp	Cut the tenderloin lengthwise into 6 long strips approximately 1/4 inch thick. Lay the slices on a cutting board; they should be the same size and shape as the bacon strips. Place a strip of bacon on top of each piece of tenderloin. Starting at one end, roll the tenderloin into a pinwheel medallion. Secure with two toothpicks.@newline@Set aside 1 cup of the Carolina Mustard Sauce and apply remaining sauce to the outside of the pinwheels. Stir together the pecans, salt, and pepper, and coat the tenderloin pinwheels with the pecan mixture. Cut each of the pinwheels through the equator to make two thin pinwheel medallions.@newline@Build a charcoal and/or wood fire for direct grilling. Place the medallions on the grill over medium-high heat (375 to 400F) and cook for 7 to 8 minutes on each side or until the edges of the bacon start to crisp. Serve with the reserved sauce drizzled over each pinwheel.	9
2504	Grilled Pineapple and Bananas with Lemonade Glaze	Use gas or hardwood charcoal when grilling fruits. Fruits absorb too much smoke flavor when grilled over wood or briquets. The trick to grilling fruit is to use fruits that are ripe but not overripe or too soft, then brush them with a glaze to bring out the sweetness. Turbinado is a natural, unrefined sugar; you can find that and cane syrup (a thick, sweet syrup used in Caribbean and Creole cooking; I use Steen's brand) at specialty markets, some grocery stores, or online. When you're grilling fruit and using a sugary glaze, it's most important to start out with a clean, oiled grill grate so the fruit is less likely to stick or taste of previously grilled foods.	1. Make a lengthwise slice on the skin of each unpeeled banana chunk to allow easy peeling after bananas are grilled. Thread the fruit onto skewers, alternating chunks of banana and pineapple.@newline@2. To make the glaze, put the sugar in a stainless-steel saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until it becomes liquid, about 3 minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon and add the lemon juice and zest. If using cane syrup, simply add the lemon juice with zest and stir, without heating. Set aside.@newline@3. Fill a charcoal chimney with hardwood lump charcoal, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of the grill and spread evenly. For a gas grill, turn to medium-high.@newline@4. Brush the skewered fruits with the glaze. Place the skewers over direct heat. Grill 3 minutes on each side, until fruit is browned. Remove from grill and brush again with the glaze. Serve immediately.	9
2505	Vine-Smoked Trout	Trout rule the mountain streams of America. I remember the fantastic flavor of freshly caught trout in Wyoming cooked over a campfire. They were so delicious, we had trout for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This recipe echoes that experience, sans the stinging nettles and porcupines. If you like, you could also stuff the trout with an herb or horseradish butter, fresh lemon slices, or a cornbread stuffing.p	1. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light, or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to medium. Rub the trout all over with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.@newline@2. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals, or place them in a metal container close to a burner on a gas grill. Place the trout on the grill grate on the indirect-heat side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.@newline@3. Smoke the trout at 225 to 250F for 45 to 60 minutes or until the fish begins to flake when tested with a fork in the thickest part and has a smoky aroma. Garnish with rosemary or sage leaves and lemon wedges.	6
2506	Broccoli Cheddar Cornbread	Pat: Broccoli in cornbreadwho knew? But sometimes you need to go to great lengths, and be very crafty, to get your kids to eat more vegetables. The result in this instance is a moist, incredibly satisfying cornbread that gets added richness from both cottage and cheddar cheese. We call for frozen broccoli, which makes this recipe easy enough to whip together in the time it takes your oven to preheat. (You can also use 2 1/2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli.)	Preheat the oven to 375F.@newline@Heat the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the onion, and saut until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and broccoli to the skillet, and saut for 2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and the broccoli has warmed through. In a medium bowl, stir together the cornbread mix, milk, cottage cheese, eggs, salt, and 1 cup of the cheddar cheese until smooth, then pour the batter into the skillet over the vegetables and stir to blend. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the remaining cheese. Bake the cornbread in the skillet for about 30 minutes, until it is lightly golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve.	4
2507	Dirty Steak	Dwight Eisenhower wasn't the first or only cook to grill steaks directly on hot coals, but he was the most famous one to do it. One of many stories about Ike in the Eisenhower Library archives relates that he liked three-inch beef strip steaksalso called New York strip, shell steak, or Kansas City stripcompletely covered with salt and pepper, then placed directly on white-hot coals for a rare, charry-crusted steak that can be addictive. Sorry, gas grillers, but no dirty-steak cooking on your grillyou need the coals for this one! I have also grilled thick chuck roastssimilar to Ike's famous three-inch steaksthis way, cooking each side at least 15 minutes directly on the coals, with delicious results. This technique works well for any relatively tender protein of a uniform thickness; branch out and try thick pork chops or even a thick tuna steak.	1. Sprinkle both sides of steaks liberally with salt and pepper. Set aside.@newline@2. Fill a charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill. Cover half of your bottom grate with briquets.@newline@3. When the briquets are white-hot, place each steak directly onto the hot coals using long-handled tongs or a fork. Leave steaks on the coals for 2 minutes. Turn them over and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes for rare (125F on a meat thermometer). For medium-rare (135F) to medium (140F), leave the steaks on the coals for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the steaks from the coals and brush off the ashes. Spread melted butter over the top and a squeeze of lemon before serving, if you desire.	11
2508	Salmon and Corn Chowder	This chowder is easy to make and requires only one pot. The salmon comes out tender and is a good match with the dill and potatoes. For a smokier flavor, roast the ears of corn directly over the fire before removing the kernels. If you don't have fresh salmon, frozen will work fine, or you can use smoked salmon. If using smoked salmon, cut back on the salt for seasoning.	Prepare a campfire or wood-fired grill for cooking with indirect heat.@newline@Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat and saut the celery for 3 minutes. Add the potatoes, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Stir in the green onions and corn and add 2 cups of the stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender, about 15 minutes.@newline@Add the cream and simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the salmon and lemon zest and simmer gently until the salmon is just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add more stock as needed and lemon juice to taste. Taste and adjust the seasoning.@newline@Serve in bowls, topped with the dill.	4
2509	Grilled Fruit with Lemon Zabaglione	This is a very simple dessert that anyone can muster. Bananas, pineapples, and stone fruit that is firm and not too ripe are best in this recipe. Grilled fruit also make a great salad (toss in some beautiful cherries or grapes). It's also wonderful at breakfast served with yogurt and granola. And it makes a fabulous chutney when combined with raisins, juice, and Indian spices. So, when you grill fruit, grill some extra to make these other dishes.	Prepare a medium-hot fire (425 to 450F) in a wood-fired grill.@newline@Stir the sugar into the orange juice until dissolved. Brush the cut fruit with the sugar mixture.@newline@Grill the fruit, cut side down, for about 5 minutes, or until the fruit is slightly soft and well marked. Move to indirect heat and continue to cook to the desired softness. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.@newline@Slice the fruit and keep each kind in a separate bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow flavors to mix.@newline@Portion an assortment of the fruits into 6 bowls. Top with the zabaglione and garnish with mint leaves.	10
2510	Darned Good Boneless Short Ribs	Direct Heatp	1. In a medium bowl and blend together both sugars, the paprika, salt, pepper, granulated onion, and cayenne. Sprinkle the short rib pieces liberally with this mixture until coated on all sides. Let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.@newline@2. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes.@newline@3. Place the beef ribs on the grill, close the lid, and reduce the heat to medium. Turn the ribs every 3 to 5 minutes or so, so that every side gets slightly caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes total. (If your short rib pieces are small, it won't take quite this long.) The ribs should yield easily to the touch, not unlike a medium-rare steak or the way the tip of your nose feels. Reduce the heat a little more and brush the ribs with the sauce. Cover the grill and let cook for a minute or two for the sauce to set up, and then continue to turn and brush until all sides of the ribs have been glazed. Remove to a platter and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, covered with foil. Serve.	1
2511	Over-the-Coals Bistecca Fiorentina	In this campfire version of an Italian classic, the steak is cooked on the coals, though pbistecca fiorentinap is traditionally cooked on a grill over the coals. Of course you can make it on a very hot grill or griddle pan if you choose, but it's fun to watch your steak cook directly on the coals. Choose the best steak you can afford. pBuon appetito!	Prepare a hot fire in a campfire or wood-fired grill, then let the coals burn down to hot chunks of embers (a 6- to 7-second fire).@newline@Place the steak directly on the hot coals and sear. Turn the steak and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the steak is charred on one side and can easily be removed from the coals. Turn and season with more salt, pepper, and the thyme. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. If using a grill, the time needed for cooking will be 5 minutes more or so per side since the meat is above the coals rather than in the coals. Remove from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes.@newline@Toss the arugula with the garlic, the 2 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, and salt to taste.@newline@Carve the steak into 1/4-inch-thick diagonal slices. Serve immediately, topped with the arugula salad, coarse sea salt or smoked salt, and shavings of Parmesan cheese. Drizzle with more olive oil if desired.	12
2512	Smoke-Roasted Rustic Root Vegetables	If you can smoke bake a casserole, then you can also smoke roast. Smoke-roasted root vegetables take on smoke flavor at a higher temperature, generally around 350F. If you like roasted vegetables in the oven, you'll love these. As an alternative method, you can also partially slow smoke vegetables, then transfer them indoors to your oven to finish roasting and crisping at a higher temperature. Substitute other root vegetables, such as parsnips, beets, turnips, and rutabagas, if you like. This recipe works well in a gas grill, too.	1. Toss the vegetables with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place the mixture on an 8 x 12-inch piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil or in a disposable aluminum pan.@newline@2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light, or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to medium.@newline@3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals or place them in a metal container as close as possible to a burner on a gas grill. Place the vegetables on the indirect-heat side. Close the lid.@newline@4. Smoke at 350F for 45 to 60 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and the vegetables have a good, smoky aroma. Transfer the vegetables to a platter, drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired, and garnish with the chopped parsley.	2
2513	Strawberry-Vanilla Swirled Frozen Pops	No need to wait for the ice cream truck. These colorful homemade pops capture the warm-weather synergy of ripe strawberries and creamy vanilla.	Mash strawberries in a large bowl with a potato masher or a fork. Transfer to a 12-inch nonstick skillet along with sugar and lemon juice and boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, then freeze, uncovered, until cold, about 10 minutes.@newline@Transfer ice cream to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 30 percent power in 10-second intervals, stirring, until softened, about 50 seconds total. Spread evenly in a 13-by 9-inch baking dish and freeze while strawberry mixture chills.@newline@Dollop tablespoons of strawberry mixture all over ice cream, then swirl it gently through ice cream with a spoon. Spoon into molds (or into cups) and add sticks. Freeze until firm, about 1 1/4 hours (and up to 4 days, covered).	3
2514	Spaghetti with Sardines, Dill and Fried Capers	If you're not a fan of canned sardines yet, heres a great introduction: Sicilian-inspired pasta packed with meaty fish, crisp-fried capers, and plenty of dill. Did we mention the toasted fresh bread crumbs?	Cook spaghetti in a pasta pot of well- salted boiling water until al dente.@newline@Meanwhile, heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Fry capers until they "bloom" and are just a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Toast bread crumbs in same skillet, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss with capers, dill, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.@newline@Add sardines to skillet with their oil (if using 3 cans sardines, discard oil from 1 can) over medium-high heat, then force garlic through a garlic press into skillet. Saut until sardines are golden in spots around edges, about 2 minutes.@newline@Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain pasta. Add pasta to skillet with cooking water and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Toss until pasta is coated and sauce is slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve topped with seasoned crumbs.	6
2515	Penne with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Arugula	Remember those sun-dried tomatoes lurking in the back of your refrigerator? Their punch gives pasta an instant boost.	Cook pancetta in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Transfer pancetta with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Add onion, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in cream, sun-dried tomatoes, and pancetta and simmer until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, then add arugula and stir until just wilted, about 1 minute.@newline@Meanwhile, cook penne in a pasta pot of well-salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.@newline@Add pasta and cheese to skillet and toss with sauce. Thin sauce with some of reserved cooking water, then stir in basil.	9
2516	Sake Sea Bass in Parchment	The advantage of cooking something in parchment is that it steams in its own juices. Here, sea bass is baked with a heady combination of sake, soy sauce, and ginger. Pair it with stir-fried bok choy and cabbage for a straightforward yet sophisticated dinner.	Preheat oven to 400F with a baking sheet on bottom rack.@newline@Stir together sake, soy sauce, ginger, and sugar in a bowl.@newline@If fish fillets are more than 4 inches long, fold ends under. Put a fish fillet in center of each parchment square and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt (total). Working with 1 portion at a time, sprinkle fish with some of scallions and spoon some of sake mixture over top (hold up 2 corners of parchment to prevent liquid from running off). Gather sides of parchment up over fish to form a pouch, leaving no openings, and tie tightly with string.@newline@Bake on hot baking sheet until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.	9
2517	Tortilla Chicken Drumsticks	Tortilla chips go well with more than just salsa, and if youre looking for crunchy drumsticks, why not start with a coating thats particularly crunchy in the first place?	Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle. Oil a large 4-sided sheet pan.@newline@Pulse chips, 2 teaspoons chili powder, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor until coarsely ground, then transfer to a shallow dish.@newline@Whisk egg and remaining 2 teaspoon chili powder in a bowl.@newline@Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip drumsticks in egg, letting excess drip off, then coat with crumbs, pressing to help them adhere. Transfer to sheet pan.@newline@Bake, without turning, until cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes.	2
2518	Savory Parmesan Pain Perdu with Poached Eggs and Greens	We're not dismissing the sweeter side of pain perdu (French toast), but custardy, golden bread just as easily goes savory. Here, its baked into a puffy, cheesy base for poached eggs and a salad.	Preheat oven to 400F with rack in middle.@newline@Butter a 1-quart shallow baking dish or a 9-inch pie plate. Arrange bread in 1 layer in dish.@newline@Whisk together milk, 1 egg, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Pour over bread. Sprinkle with cheese and press lightly to help bread absorb custard. Let stand until absorbed, 15 to 30 minutes.@newline@Dot with butter and bake, uncovered, until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.@newline@Bring 2 inches water to a boil with a few drops of vinegar in a small deep skillet or saucepan. Break each remaining egg into a cup and slide into water, spacing eggs apart. Poach at a bare simmer to desired doneness (we prefer firm whites with runny yolks, 2 to 3 minutes).@newline@Meanwhile, toss greens with remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, oil, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.@newline@Divide pain perdu between 2 plates and top with salad. Lift eggs out of poaching liquid 1 at a time with a slotted spoon and place on top of salad. Lightly season eggs with salt and pepper.	11
2519	Roasted Potato Wedges with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise	Thick-cut seasoned potatoes can be roasted along with ptortilla chicken drumsticksp . The mayonnaise works as a zesty dip for both, so you may want to double the amount.	Roast potatoes: Put a 4-sided sheet pan in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450F.@newline@Stir cumin, oregano, and 3/4 teaspoon salt into oil in a large bowl. Add potatoes and toss. Arrange potatoes, cut sides down, in 1 layer in hot pan and roast, turning once, until golden, about 40 minutes.	7
2520	The Stout Diplomat	Yanni Kehagiaras of San Francisco's Nopa restaurant created this dessert drink for a beer-cocktail competition. He says, "The rum is in there to give this beer cocktail a bit of a punch. I wanted to use a dark rum, but nothing too spicy or funky that would take the focus away from the beer. So I chose Diplomatico, which adds a subtle sweetness and caramel flavor without clashing." That approachand this drinkis likely to wins fans on both sides of the beer/cocktail divide.	In a small, 5-ounce Delmonico glass (the one that holds orange juice at diners), combine rum, sherry, and stout. Serve immediately.	5

2527	Caramel-Apple Tartlets with Cinnamon-Rum Ice Cream	This tartlet is complex, but well worth the effort. It sprang from the mind of our bakery's apple-obsessed chef, Eric Wolitzky (he is from the apple heartland of upstate New York), who was attempting to wring more flavor from the traditional apple pie. Were still huge fans of the classic, but this versionwith its perfect ratio of caramel to apple to buttery crust and crunchy toppingis now our must have apple dessert. At the bakery, we put the tartlets out at noon, and they are gone by 12:30 p.m., so we feel fairly confident that people share our new obsession.	For crust: Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in medium bowl until blended. Beat in egg. Add flour and salt and beat just until incorporated. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.@newline@Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Gather each piece into ball, then flatten each slightly. Roll out each dough piece on lightly floured surface to 4- to 41/2-inch round. Press 1 dough round onto bottom and up sides of 41/2-inch-diameter tartlet pan with removable bottom. Pierce crust all over with fork. Repeat with remaining dough rounds. Freeze crusts 30 minutes.@newline@Preheat oven to 375F. Bake crusts until golden brown and baked through, about 30 minutes. Cool crusts in pans on rack. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight in pans at room temperature.	7

Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in both sugars, then eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in extracts, then flour mixture. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheets, spacing mounds 2 to 3 inches apart. Using moist fingertips, flatten mounds to 3/4-inch thickness.@newline@Bake cookies 5 minutes. Reverse sheets. Bake until cookies are puffed and dry-looking but soft to touch, about 5 minutes. Cool completely. Freeze on sheets 15 minutes.@newline@Spoon 1/3 cup gelato onto flat side of 1 cookie. Top with second cookie, flat side down; press together. Wrap and freeze. Repeat with remaining gelato and cookies. DO AHEAD: Keep frozen up to 2 days.	9
2529	Peanut Butter Banana Cream Pie	This pie was almost my obsession. I desperately wanted a banana cream pie that wasn't too sweet, and I couldn't find one with the right consistency or the right banana flavor. I think this is pretty close to perfect, and the flavors marry well with the Elvis-inspired peanut butter layer.	For vanilla wafer crust: Preheat oven to 350F. Combine all ingredients in processor; blend until mixture resembles moist crumbs, about 1 minute. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish and press mixture onto bottom and up sides (not rim) of dish. Bake crust until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven; press crust with back of spoon if puffed. Cool crust completely.	4
2530	White Beans with Tasso	NoDescription	Stir 3 1/4 cups water and all remaining ingredients in large slow cooker. Cover and cook on high until beans are tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water if dry, about 4 1/2 hours. Remove ham hock. Cut off all meat; shred and return to beans. Season to taste with salt and pepper.	8
2531	Double-Dutch Mac and Cheese with Chard	Try as we might, we couldn't find a substitute for mac and cheeseand we certainly weren't going to leave it off the list. This is the dish that will still be appearing on American tables hundreds of years from now. But mac and cheese in 2009 certainly doesn't lookor tastethe same as it did back in the day. The casserole keeps reflecting our changing tastes. We've seen versions made with every kind of pasta, lighter variations packed with veggies, and super-luxe options redolent of truffle oil. To make mac and cheese truly your own, get creative with the cheese. Here, we use a combination of two of the Netherlands' best-known cheeses: Gouda and Edam.	Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large pot over medium heat. Add onion; saut until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, then flour; stir constantly 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups coarsely grated Gouda and 1 cup Edam. Stir until cheeses melt, about 2 minutes. Stir in cayenne and nutmeg. Season sauce with salt and pepper.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F. Butter 13x9x2- inch baking dish. Cook chard in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, transfer chard to plate; cool. Reserve pot with water. Squeeze water from chard; chop finely.@newline@Return water in pot to boil. Add macaroni; cook until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Stir macaroni into warm cheese sauce. Place half of macaroni in dish; smooth top. Top with 1 cup Edam cheese, then chard. Top with remaining macaroni mixture; spread evenly.@newline@Melt 3 tablespoons butter. Place breadcrumbs in medium bowl. Drizzle butter over; toss. Add 1/2 cup finely grated Gouda and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss. Sprinkle breadcrumb mixture over mac and cheese. Sprinkle cumin seeds over, if desired.@newline@Bake mac and cheese until breadcrumbs are golden and edges are bubbling, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.	6
2532	Beef Shank and Sausage Rag with Whole Grain Spaghetti	Beef Shank and Sausage pRagp with Whole Grain Spaghetti* As much as we love eating at old-school red-sauce joints, we're craving the updated regional Italian cuisine were seeing at restaurants across the country. In this dish, instead of marinara, we've got a rich, meaty pragp (a staple in Bologna) made with flavorful bone-in beef shanks and hot Italian sausage. Hearty whole grain pasta is the perfect vehicle for the sauce (and it's a great way to add nutritional value). The long-cooked sauce is the ideal thing to make on a lazy weekend and fills the house with delicious aromas.	For rag: Preheat oven to 350F. Toast fennel seeds in small dry skillet over medium-low heat until slightly darker in color and very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Set aside.@newline@Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large oven-proof pot over medium heat. Add sausage. Cook until brown and cooked through, breaking up with back of spoon, about 10 minutes.

2533	Thai Green Curry with Seafood	When the topic of chowder comes up, debates rage about the merits of the creamy New England style versus the red, tomato-packed Manhattan version. We'd be hard-pressed to choose a favorite, but one thing is for sure: We love chowder. It's comforting, hearty, and full of seafood. The same can be said of Thai-style seafood curry. Coconut milk stands in for cream, and curry paste packs a warming punch. Its global chowder and it's delicious. That's something we can all agree on.	Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add white and pale green parts of green onions, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and garlic; saut until tender, about 2 minutes. Add curry paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

2534	Grilled Grass-Fed Rib-Eye Steaks with Balsamic-Caper Vinaigrette	When it comes to steak, Americans are learning that less meat can be more: more eco-friendly, more healthful, and more delicious. Instead of that huge T-bone or porterhouse, try a smaller rib-eye steakand make sure it's grass-fed. Grass-fed beef is lower in fat and calories than conventionally raised beef and contains omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), which may boost the immune system and help lower the risk of cancer and heart disease. Keep the goodness going by skipping that pat of blue-cheese butter and drizzling the meat with a simple vinaigrette.p	Simmer vinegar in small pan over medium heat until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 6 minutes. Add shallots, 1/4 cup oil, and crushed red pepper; return to simmer. Remove from heat; whisk in parsley, capers, and thyme. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.@newline@Rub both sides of steaks with oil and garlic. Mix paprika, 2 teaspoons coarse salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper in small bowl.

2535	Open-Face Crab Burgers with Red Pepper Dressing	The burger's undeniable appeal and infinite flexibility have inspired culinary luminaries like Bobby Flay and Laurent Tourondel to devote entire restaurants to the humble sandwich. And despite what purists might say, some of todays best burgers aren't even made with beef. Patties made of lamb, bison, or seafood (like the crab burgers here) are increasingly popular. Toasted bread, a pita pocket, or even a lettuce leaf are fun standins for the traditional bun. In our homage to the modern burger, the crab patties are served open-face with a spicy red pepper dressing.	For dressing: Mix all ingredients in small bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper.	4
2536	Zinfandel-Braised Beef Short Ribs with Rosemary-Parsnip Mashed Potatoes	Ask any butcher: Humble cuts are hot. They're full of flavor and far less expensive than prime cuts. Of the humble cuts, short ribs are one of our favorites. Theyre meaty and fatty (in the best possible way) and still on the bone, which adds delicious depth of flavor. And who says you have to throw all the veggies into the stew? Here, we toss some parsnips into the pot and serve a great potato-parsnip mash on the side.	For ribs: Preheat oven to 325F. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large oven-proof pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle ribs with coarse salt and pepper. Add to pot in single layer and saut until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer ribs to large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon butter to pot. Add onions; saut until brown, about 6 minutes.

Rewarm over low heat before serving.	6
2537	Sun-dried Tomato and Fennel Sausage Patties with Creamy Polenta	Fennel pollen, a relatively new spice here in America, is very popular in Italy. It is more subtle and delicate than fennel seeds, and it marries particularly well with pork. If you can't find fennel pollen, substitute freshly ground fennel seeds.	For sausage: Place half of pork and half of fat in processor. Using on/off turns, blend until pork is ground to coarse texture (about 1/4-inch cubes). Scrape into large bowl. Repeat with remaining pork and fat. Add all remaining sausage ingredients to bowl with pork and mix gently with hands until blended. Using wet hands, shape sausage into 10 oval patties, each about 3/4 inch thick. Place on plastic-lined plate. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.	7
2538	Pork Chops with Leeks in Mustard Sauce	If you use commercial pork in this recipe, you might want to rub the chops with the salt mixture and let them sit for a full day in the fridge.

2569	Spinach Salad with Strawberry Vinaigrette	Spinach and strawberry salad had its moment in the '80s, but this version will surprise you with its refinement. The salad is not sweet, just aromatic  and coming across fresh berries every now and then provides bursts of fruitiness. The pecans are simply toasted, but once they're coated with vinaigrette, you'd swear they were candied. Raspberries would work well here, too.	Whisk together vinegar, a rounded 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking well. Put spinach, strawberries, and pecans in a large bowl and toss with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat.	8
2570	Stewed Corn and Tomatoes with Okra	If you haven't had maque choux  corn and tomatoes stewed together  you're really in for a treat. In this favorite Cajun dish, the corn gains a lush, savory sauciness, while the tomato benefits from the kernels' gentle chew. Here, okra is added and cooked just until tender, bringing its own unique texture to the mix.	Cook scallions, jalapeo, bell pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until scallions begin to brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until broken down into a sauce, about 15 minutes.@newline@Add corn and okra and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.	3
2571	Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken	As in the classic recipe from Richard Olney's Simple French Food that inspired this one, two key innovations ensure a moist, incredibly succulent chicken. First, the birds are spatchcocked, meaning they're butterflied and spread flat so that both the white meat and the dark can be perfectly cooked; second, an herbed-ricotta filling is pushed under the skin, puffing slightly during cooking and extending the meat's flavor in a creamy direction. Actually, you'll notice how much we liked the filling  we call for extra to be baked in a separate dish so that everyone gets a helping. The filling becomes a cross between a popover and a souffl in texture, with oregano and parsley supplying a suggestion of the Provenal countryside.	Make filling: Preheat oven to 400F with racks in middle and lower third.@newline@Cook garlic in oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in ricotta, eggs, parmesan, herbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.	4
2572	Mesclun Salad	Whether assertive farmers-market mesclun or a delicate supermarket mix, these greens require little more than a light lemony vinaigrette  and one that can be made quickly embraces the simplicity of the leaves.	Whisk together lemon juice, mustard, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until salt and sugar are dissolved, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.@newline@Add greens to dressing and toss to coat. Serve immediately.	5
2573	Ziti with Grilled-Gazpacho Sauce and Sausage	The classic cold soup seems almost restrained next to this lusty dish  gazpacho ingredients are grilled, then tossed with pasta and cheese (some of the vegetables are pured to make a tangy sauce that lightly cloaks the whole).

2575	Apple Celery Granita	The best desserts are those that manage to be sweetly satisfying while also containing an element of surprise, and this unique granita certainly fits the bill. We first had a version of it at Manhattan's Walls, and were stunned by the interplay among the bright, verdant mix of apple and celery with the richness of olive oil and the heat of grated horseradish. (Here, we've substituted wasabi for the horseradish.) It's a truly sophisticated way to end a meal.	Put crushed vitaminutes C and sugar in a 1-quart container that will fit under spout of juicer.@newline@Using juicer, juice apples and celery into container. Spoon off foam and stir until sugar is dissolved.@newline@Pour into an 8- to 9-inch square stainless-steel or glass baking pan and freeze until partially frozen, about 1 hour.

2585	The Retro Highball	Classic Highballs called for club soda and a spirit, but over the years included sweeter mixers (the gin and tonic is one such version; the Moscow Mule, another). We suggest a return to the dry version, which allows premium spirits to shine.	A matter of preference, naturally. A ratio of 2 ounces spirit to 2 ounces soda is a good place to start if you truly want to savor the base spirit in all its glory. If it's too much, add soda 1 ounce at a time until it suits your taste. Measure along the way and make a note of your preference so that you'll always know just how much to pour.	3

2595	Spice-Rubbed Steak with Quick Garlic Fries	This variation on steak frites spices up the steak and gives a garlic boost to frozen fries. You can use any packaged spice-rub mix for beef, but we use a combination of equal parts cumin and coriander, half that amount of salt and pepper, and one eighth that amount of clove. If your rub doesn't contain salt, you'll need to add some, to taste. This take on a classic meal is easy, but you will be searing the steak and frying the potatoes at the same time.	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450F.@newline@Heat 1 inch oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until it registers 375F on thermometer.@newline@While oil heats, pat steaks dry, then rub all over with spice rub (and salt if necessary).

Stuff large cavity with onion and thyme sprigs and tie drumsticks together with kitchen string. Brush skin all over with some melted butter.@newline@Put turkey on rack in a large flameproof roasting pan and roast, basting with some melted butter and/or pan juices every 20 minutes (if turkey is browning too fast, cover loosely with foil), until thermometer inserted into fleshy part of a thigh (do not touch bone) registers 170F, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours.@newline@Carefully tilt turkey so any juices from inside large cavity run into roasting pan, then transfer turkey to a platter (do not clean roasting pan) and let stand, loosely covered, 30 minutes (temperature of thigh meat will rise to 180F).	4
2601	Candied-Orange and Cranberry Compote	This is a sweet dessert compote  it does not go with the turkey. The oranges are cooked to make sure all the bitterness is released, so it's important that they're sliced very thin  an extremely sharp thin-bladed knife is best for the task.	Bring water and sugar to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add orange and gently simmer over moderately low heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until peel begins to turn translucent and syrup is reduced to about 2/3 cup, 25 to 35 minutes.@newline@Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cool. Stir in cranberries and Grand Marnier and chill, covered, until cold, about 1 hour.	12
2602	Coffee-Braised Short Ribs with Ancho Chile	Relish each step of preparing coffee- and chile-braised short ribs: Searing a brown crust on the ribs before they bake adds a deep caramelized flavor; sauting the aromatics (onions, peppers, garlic) in the drippings makes the sauce base really fragrant.	Preheat oven to 300F. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle short ribs with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add ribs to pot and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter.@newline@Add onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeo to drippings in pot.

2604	Raised Cappuccino Doughnuts with Espresso Cream Filling	While any yeast dough can be kneaded by hand, this one is done in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough-hook attachment  it's the fastest, easiest way to get the best texture.p	For topping: Blend sugar,cocoa powder, and cinnamon in small bowl.	9
2605	Jeweled Rice with Dried Fruit	Here, you only boil the rice briefly before combining it with the dried fruit and cooking it without water. We adapted this rice from a Persian method that yields a buttery crust (called ptah-digp) on the bottom of the pan  later the crust is served with the rice. Usually you have to dip the pot in cold water at the end of cooking to release the crust, but a happy kitchen accident occurred when we tested this recipe. Food editor Ruth Cousineau let the rice stand for almost an hour (things can get hectic when you're preparing a holiday meal), and the crust came right out without the dipping. Using a heavy pot helps keep the rice hot, too.	Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a large bowl until water runs clear. Drain in a large sieve.@newline@Bring water and salt to a boil in a 6-quart heavy pot, then add rice and boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes from time water returns to boil. Drain rice in sieve.@newline@Toss together dried fruit in a bowl. Melt 6 tablespoons butter with cardamom and pepper in cleaned and dried pot, stirring to combine, then alternately layer rice and dried fruit over it, beginning and ending with rice and mounding loosely. Make 5 or 6 holes in rice to bottom of pot with round handle of a wooden spoon, then cover pot with a kitchen towel and a heavy lid. Fold edges of towel up over lid (to keep towel from burning) and cook rice over moderately low heat, undisturbed, until tender and a crust forms on bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice stand, tightly covered and undisturbed, at least 30 minutes.@newline@Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over moderate heat and cook pistachios, stirring, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.@newline@Spoon loose rice onto a platter, then break crust into 1-inch pieces and scatter over rice. Sprinkle with pistachios.	7
2606	Celery-Root Pure with Truffle Butter	Truffles add a flavorful woodsy note, but if you make this French-influenced celery-root pure without them, it will still be delicious.	Cover celery root and potatoes with cold salted water by 2 inches in a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot, then simmer, covered, until celery root is very tender, about 15 minutes.@newline@While vegetables are simmering, bring cream, truffle butter, salt, and pepper just to a simmer, stirring until butter is melted.@newline@Drain vegetables in a colander and transfer to a food processor.

2744	Bill Gross's Burnt Orange Ice Cream	Bill Gross, who was executive sous chef at Caf Gray in New York City, was kind enough to create this recipe for meand it is simply delicious. The technique is fascinating, but it does require some careful watching while the sugar caramelizes. The oranges are prepared two days ahead, and the ice cream one day aheadand the waiting is well worth it!	1. One day ahead, prepare the oranges: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat the oven to 450F.@newline@2. Place 1/2 cup of the sugar on a plate. Rub the butter over the oranges, then roll them in the sugar.@newline@3. Pour the unused sugar from the plate into an 8-inch square baking pan, and shake it around to cover the bottom of the pan.

Remove the pan from the oven (leaving the oven on), and using tongs and a sharp knife, carefully quarter the oranges. Place the quarters, skin side up, in the baking pan and bake until the peel is dark brown, about 35 minutes. Let the orange quarters cool slightly.@newline@5. Remove the peel from 4 of the browned quarters, discarding the pulp. Leave the other 4 quarters intact.@newline@6. Combine the orange peel, the 4 intact quarters, the sugar from the pan, and the remaining 2 cups sugar in a food processor, and puree. Strain the puree into a container, cover it, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.@newline@7. The next day, prepare the ice cream mixture: Place the orange puree in a saucepan over medium-low heat, and bring it to a simmer.@newline@8. While the orange puree is heating, whisk the cream, half-and-half, vanilla seeds, and egg yolks together in a large bowl. Then, whisking constantly, slowly add the hot orange puree. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate it until it is cold, 3 to 4 hours.@newline@9. Freeze the mixture in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.@newline@10. Transfer the ice cream to a container, cover, and store in the freezer until ready to serve.	10

2748	Bacon Swiss Burgers with Tomato and Avocado	A bacon Swiss burger embellished with ripe tomato and avocado: delectable! In this burger, I've spiced up the meat with thyme and Worcestershire sauce, which hint at the Mediterranean and at the steak house. In this case, a soft white bun is the best choiceany other type of bun and the burger might become too huge to eat. But of course, that's what helps to make it delectable. Serve your favorite condiments alongside.	1. If you will be grilling the burgers, preheat a barbecue grill to medium-high.@newline@2. While the grill is heating up, cook the bacon on the stovetop in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it is just crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels and set it aside to drain. (If you prefer to panfry the burgers, reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the skillet.)@newline@3. Place the beef, Worcestershire, Tabasco, thyme, and salt and pepper in a bowl, and toss lightly with a fork to combine. Form the mixture into 4 patties, each about 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.@newline@4. When you are ready to grill the burgers, oil the grill grate well. Add the burgers and grill for about 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium-rare meat. Turn them over and grill for another 3 or 4 minutes, topping the burgers with the cheese in the last minute of cooking. (Or panfry the burgers in the hot bacon fat over medium heat for 3 minutes per side for rare meat, adding the cheese as described.)@newline@5. Place the burgers on the toasted buns, and top them with the bacon, tomato, onion, avocado, and lettuce. Cover with the tops of the buns and serve immediately.	8

2750	Rum-Scented Marble Cake	Marble cakes are both homey and festive. A marble cake looks slick when you slice into it and reveal the delicate pattern created when the two batters are swirled together. My first experience working with this type of mixture came about as the result of a marbled chocolate terrine that appeared first in the pages of the old pCook's Magazinep, and then in my chocolate book. Everything about it was rightthe texture, the flavor, the quantity of mixture in relation to the moldeverything, that is, except the marbling. Even when I barely mixed the white and dark chocolate mixtures, what I got was a few streaks of dark and white, and mostly a muddy combined color. After several frustrating attempts, I realized that I had too much dark chocolate mixture and I recast the recipe so there was twice as much white chocolate as dark and the terrine marbled perfectly. So this marble cake is proportioned in the same way: Rather than dividing the base batter in half, I like to remove about one third of it and add the chocolate. Thanks to my old friend Ceri Hadda, who shared her mother's recipe years ago.	1. Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325F (160C).@newline@2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir well by hand to mix. Add the butter. Beat the mixture on low speed with the paddle until the mixture is a smooth, heavy paste, 1 to 2 minutes.@newline@3. Whisk the eggs and rum together. On medium speed, beat 1/3 of the egg mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Beat for 1 minute.@newline@4. Stop and scrape down the bowl and beater. Add half of the egg mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Repeat with the other half.@newline@5. Remove the bowl from the mixer and using a large rubber spatula give the batter a final mix.@newline@6. For the chocolate batter, combine the rum, milk, and baking soda in a medium mixing bowl, Whisk well to dissolve the baking soda. Scrape in the chocolate and whisk it well. Add the 2 cups of base batter to the chocolate mixture and whisk well to combine.@newline@7. Scrape half the remaining base batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Cover with the chocolate batter, making it as even a layer as possible. Finally top with the remaining base batter and smooth the top. Use a wide-bladed table knife or a thin metal spatula to marble the batter: Insert the knife into the batter at the central tube, with the flat side of the blade facing you. Draw the blade through the batter to the bottom of the pan and up and out of the side of the pan closest to you, repeating the motion every inch or so around the pan, making a spiral in the batter, almost as though you were folding egg whites into it. Stop when you get back to the point where you started. Don't bother to smooth the top of the batterit might disturb the marbling.@newline@8. Bake the cake until it is well risen and firm, and a toothpick or a small thin knife inserted midway between the side of the pan and the central tube emerges dry, about 1 hour.@newline@9. Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert a rack over it. Invert and lift off the pan. Cool the cake completely over the rack.	2

2752	Clay Pot Chicken with Dates, Sucuk and Bulgur	In Turkish cookery there's a distinctive group of dishes known as pgvep, which take their name from the earthenware pot in which they are cookedin the same way that the tagine does in Morocco. In rural Anatolia the cooking pots may be sealed and buried in the ashes of a fire to cook slowly overnightor, only slightly less romantically, in the local baker's oven. If you don't have a clay pot, a heavy-based cast-iron casserole dish will serve almost as well.p@newline@pGvep dishes encompass all sorts of meat or poultry cooked with legumes, vegetables and fruits. My addition of star anise is not remotely Turkish, but it adds a wonderful layer of aniseed flavor. This pgvep is spicy with a lingering sweetness, so serve it with a light salad or braised wild greens. A dollop of yogurt would also be delicious.p	Preheat the oven to 400F. Heat the butter and extra-virgin olive oil in a heavy-based casserole dish. Gently sweat the onions, garlic, peppers and chiles with the cumin and cinnamon for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.

2758	Almond Brown-Sugar Cookies	With their simple, homespun charm, these icebox cookies are just the nibble you'll want to have on hand as you do your Christmas gift wrapping. The thinner you can slice the dough, the crisper the cookies will be, so we freeze the dough for a bit (after chilling it in the fridge) before slicing. Plus, it will be much easier to cut through the almonds and get nice, neat rounds.	Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg and vanilla. At low speed, mix in flour mixture until a dough just forms. Stir in whole almonds. Divide dough in half. Using a sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper as an aid, form each piece of dough into a log 9 to 9 1/2 inches long (about 1 1/4 inches in diameter). Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until very firm, at least 4 hours. Freeze 30 minutes to facilitate slicing.@newline@Preheat oven to 350F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut 1 log of dough crosswise into slices less than 1/8 inch thick with a thin sharp knife, rotating log after each slice to help keep round shape. (If dough gets too soft to slice through nuts easily, freeze briefly.) Arrange cookies about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets.@newline@Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer cookies on parchment to racks to cool.@newline@Repeat with remaining dough (cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment).	8
